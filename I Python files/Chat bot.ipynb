Joints hold the bones together and are designed to provide movement within the skeletal system. The main\\nfunction of bone is support, while the joints allow a certain amount of flexibility and to our structure. The synovial\\njoints, where the ends of bone are connected by a joint cavity or capsule containing synovial fluid, allow freedom and\\nfluidity in the articulation of our movements.\\nThe supportive tissues; ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue, are kapha dosha, while the joint cavity or space where\\nthe bones meet is an element ruled by vata dosha. The joint capsule provides a container for the slippery synovial fluid,\\nagain a kapha substance that lubricates the ends of the bone surfaces and also accommodates a tough, protective\\ncovering into which the ligaments and tendons can insert themselves. It is through the ligaments that nerve impulses are\\ntransmitted to the muscles signalling movement, a function of vata dosha.\\nHealthy joint tissue and function are crucial to how we move and express ourselves through our bodies. According to\\nayurveda, vitiated or disturbed vata dosha can create imbalance within the joints resulting in pain and discomfort. Most\\ncommonly affected joints are knees, ankles, elbows, wrists, fingers and toes. When there is an imbalance in the joints, it\\nis important to discern whether or not the imbalance exists with or without ama, a sticky toxic substance. A simple test\\ncan be done with organic sesame oil. Massage the oil into the joint. If the symptoms are aggravated, then there is ama\\npresent, a condition known as amavata. If the symptoms are alleviated by the oil massage, or stay the same, then the\\ntreatment will begin with the removal of the causative factors and balancing vata dosha.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.837204386416281), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='4273b720-8885-4acc-bbdd-525af6a2614e', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583', node_type=None, metadata={}, hash='53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4742ce5f-71eb-4fd5-81ea-ed11db97d4ef', node_type=None, metadata={}, hash='253ffc23f6516839e0ffd23eb24de0dc3f562640c449db478eee66dfa3a47023'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3044d3b3-cbff-4d31-99a9-411e2c05b6dd', node_type=None, metadata={}, hash='9d56f65152a65e18d06f4ab182463f895e384eb24357e23803c8d0f51a9a0158')}, hash='03dbc18b4028b97faa99ddf35b0cdb788c4a26a1ba7dcfed44d97683926df176', text=\"Sip hot, during and\\nafter meals.\\nFor pitta types: 2 pinches of Indian sarsaparilla powder, 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, 2 pinches of licorice\\npowder, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds and 1/2 teaspoon of coriander seeds.

The\\nunderlying causes of allergic symptoms are rarely from the allergens themselves, making proper Ayurvedic diagnosis\\nessential. A main causative factor of allergies is a by-product of improperly digested food. This toxic substance, called\\nama, is manufactured in the digestive system and is absorbed into the circulatory system. Once systemic, ama can block\\nand clog the channels of circulation.\\nThe removal of ama in the circulatory system will often play a primary role in the management of immediate allergic\\nhypersensitivity. Depending on body type, the underlying cause of allergic hypersensitivities will vary. It should be\\nunderstood that mental and emotional stresses are also common contributing factors in a hypersensitive allergic\\nresponse.\\nAyurveda compares the body to a field and allergens to seeds; if the land is not fertile, then any seeds that are sown will\\nnot sprout. The fertilizer is a toxic residue called ama - a sticky substance formed in the digestive system from food that\\nhas been incompletely processed. It lowers natural immunity and increases receptivity to allergens.

The presence of ama can weaken the thymus\\ngland or spleen; both of which contribute to the body's immune system and trigger allergic reactions. However, eating\\nmore of certain foods and herbs can help remove ama, bring balance to Kapha, and thus hold allergies at bay.\\nThe first step is to minimize chilled foods and high-fat dishes (such as cheese, yogurt and meat) and replace them with\\nwarm, freshly cooked foods, including plenty of asparagus and broccoli, both of which support the immune system.\\nThen integrate the herbs turmeric and tulsi (or holy basil) into your diet.\\nTurmeric activates the liver and strengthens the blood to help remove ama, and research shows that turmeric's active\\ningredient, curcumin, has an anti-allergic effect.

You can also bring a cup of milk to the boil, remove it from the heat, add a bay leaf\\nand a pinch each of turmeric and cinnamon and then drink it warm.\\nHoly basil strengthens the immune system, reduces ama, and helps remove environmental pollution from the body.

The\\nunderlying causes of allergic symptoms are rarely from the allergens themselves, making proper Ayurvedic diagnosis\\nessential. A main causative factor of allergies is a by-product of improperly digested food. This toxic substance, called\\nama, is manufactured in the digestive system and is absorbed into the circulatory system. Once systemic, ama can block\\nand clog the channels of circulation.\\nThe removal of ama in the circulatory system will often play a primary role in the management of immediate allergic\\nhypersensitivity. Depending on body type, the underlying cause of allergic hypersensitivities will vary. It should be\\nunderstood that mental and emotional stresses are also common contributing factors in a hypersensitive allergic\\nresponse.\\nAyurveda compares the body to a field and allergens to seeds; if the land is not fertile, then any seeds that are sown will\\nnot sprout. The fertilizer is a toxic residue called ama - a sticky substance formed in the digestive system from food that\\nhas been incompletely processed. It lowers natural immunity and increases receptivity to allergens. This toxic byproduct migrates to the body’s points of weakness, creating a vicious cycle by lowering resistance even more.\\nAllergies to pollen and other plant materials also involve an imbalance of the Kapha dosha, which controls the lungs,\\nsinuses, and fluid balance in the body.
