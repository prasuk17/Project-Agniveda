About the Authors

Danny Cavanagh and Carol Willis began their study of Ayurveda in the late 1980s and trained as
Ayurvedic Panchakarma Technicians at the Maharishi University of Valkenburg in Holland in 1993. Since
that time they have also studied with the renowned Dr Vacant Lad at the Ayurvedic Institute in New
Mexico and Dr David Frawley and Atreya Smith at the American and European Institute of Ayurveda. The
subjects they have studied include pulse reading, Ayurvedic herbology, Ayurvedic diet and nutrition and
Marma therapy. They gave up their careers as Nature Reserve Warden and Photographer respectively and
decided to dedicate their lives to passing on this ancient knowledge of rejuvenation and revitalisation to
others.

They have run many centres across the UK and have treated thousands of clients, including many highprofile celebrities and members of the royal family. In their role as both massage therapists and personal
development/stress management counsellors they have witnessed extraordinary improvements in the
quality of life of many of their guests due to the power of the programs they administer.
Presently they run a very exclusive Panchakarma detox and stress management service in Staffordshire
where they take one client at a time and gently guide them in the Ayurvedic way of living harmoniously
with their environment. Each client receives instruction in meditation, yoga and exercise and advice on
diet and nutrition but the highlight of each day is often the luxurious two-hour massage and detoxification
therapy they receive. Danny and Carol also offer business clients a detox retreat program in a beautiful
setting in the Peak District as, amongst other things, the knowledge of body-types is an invaluable aid to
understanding their colleagues’ innate strengths, weaknesses and behaviour. Learning in a group is an
excellent team building exercise and helps forge and strengthen business relationships. As if their
schedule isn’t busy enough, they also occasionally administer Ayurvedic detox and education retreats in
Europe and the USA, travelling with their team of Ayurvedic massage technicians and custom-built
treatment equipment to their client’s homes, albeit usually very large homes.
Primarily, they consider themselves facilitators and maintain that, whilst they may help carry out the
various massage and counselling therapies, it is the client who ultimately allows the changes to their
health, emotions, behaviour and healing to take place. They are committed to spreading the knowledge of
Ayurveda and spend much of their time acting as an advice service to both clients and public alike.

Introduction
This book has been compiled to provide a practical help guide to those interested in following a healthy
Ayurvedic lifestyle. With complementary therapies and esoteric philosophies becoming much more
widely accepted and available in the west many people are interested in finding out more. However,
whilst there is a wealth of information in the public domain, there is little in the way of sound, practical
advice available to the lay person, especially in the field of Ayurveda. We hope this book will address
some of these shortfalls and provide a practical basis for self-improvement.
As an all encompassing holistic health-care system, the science of Ayurveda can be viewed as an
umbrella discipline or ‘mother’ of many modern-day alternative therapies. Having been a successful
primary health-care modality for millions of people for many thousands of years it’s translation as ‘the
knowledge of life’ is most apt. The oldest written records originate in India and date back over 2000
years and its recommendations and advice for healthy living are as relevant today they ever were – and
probably even more so.
An important aspect of Ayurveda lies in its ability to understand and describe the subtle energies and
intelligence flowing through our bodies. Ayurvedic doctors skilled in the ancient practice of pulse reading
are able to accurately diagnose imbalances in an individual on a mental, physical, emotional and spiritual
level. This allows them to prescribe very effective herbal and behavioural remedies. Unfortunately, as this
skill is traditionally passed down verbally from one generation of Vaidyas (Ayurvedic doctors) to the
next, much of this art has been lost and it is now rarely taught in Ayurvedic collages and universities. It is
not a subject we will address in this book but it is well worth finding an Ayurvedic practitioner that is
skilled in this field if you have severe chronic health problems.
However, the Ayurvedic texts contain a treasure trove of knowledge based on its profound understanding
of the deeper workings of nature and the rhythms and cycles that govern all life on earth. This knowledge
is practical, easy to understand and is suitable for anyone interested in improving their physical, mental
and spiritual health. It is our aim to faithfully present this knowledge in clear, easy-to-follow steps which
you can slowly introduce into your life if you have choose to take responsibility for your own health and
well-being and are willing to dedicate a little time and effort.
In the first chapter you will learn how to ascertain your unique Ayurvedic body-type. You will also learn
how to recognise imbalances in your body-type when you stray from your natural way of being and, most
importantly, how you can rectify them through diet and lifestyle adaptations. If we insist in following
inappropriate diets or lifestyles for prolonged periods of time our body begins to malfunction and slowly
but surely deteriorates. As toxins build up in the mind and body we become prone to persistent aches and
pains and feelings of unease, anxiety or depression. If these signs and symptoms of ‘dis-ease’ are left
unchecked we eventually begin to show signs of premature aging and suffer from more chronic
conditions. By following the guidelines for your particular body-type or imbalance the immune,
digestive, endocrine and nervous system will be gently and naturally brought back into balance and good
health and a calm, focused mind will ensue.
Firstly you should identify your body-type - the body-type questionnaire will help you do this. A visit to
an Ayurvedic consultant trained in pulse reading will help ensure a more accurate assessment but as these
are still few and far between in the west the questionnaire is the next best alternative. Once you have
ascertained your psycho-physiological make-up it is then a simple matter of following the general
guidelines for your specific doshic make-up (body-type). However, you may need to adapt this slightly

to take account of the time of year and the imbalances that are present in your physiology. If you’re one
of the lucky few who are relatively well balanced you’ll probably find you are naturally following some
of these practices already.
It is worth bearing in mind that maintaining good digestion and ensuring a clean, fully-functioning colon
are the key to physical health, mental well-being, spiritual harmony and the absence of ‘dis-ease’. Eating
the right foods to balance your body-type is the key to proper digestion. Different body-types require
very different foods but once you know your Ayurvedic body-type you can tailor the foods you eat on a
regular basis to help keep the mind and body functioning properly and operating in perfect balance. The
key is moderation and maintaining an adequate supply of the foods that are good for you and reducing
those that aren’t so good. Also, the secret of attaining your perfect weight isn’t necessarily totally
dependant on regulating the amount you eat or the number of calories you consume, but more often the
choice of foods you eat, the times at which they are eaten and the manner in which they are eaten.
In chapter two we introduce you to the natural cycles of nature and describe methods that can be utilised
for to keep your physiology in alignment with these ever-changing patterns of energy. Although we can’t
see these energy cycles we can feel their varying ‘flavours’ as day turns to night or summer turns to
winter. We can also witness the unpleasant effects of falling out of alignment with these cycles but,
conversely, can also enjoy the pleasure of keeping in tune with the rhythm of these energy flows. The
exercise and yoga routines will keep the body supple and free of toxins, while the breathing exercises and
meditation will help balance the mind. A balanced mind creates calmness, health and vitality.
Lifestyle and behaviour play another key role in maintaining balance and harmony in your mind and body
and again different body-types require slightly different approaches. However, the exercise and yoga
routines we’ve included in this book can be followed by just about anyone and will have a beneficial
effect on the health and wellbeing of everyone who is motivated to putting in a little practice each day.
You should consult your GP before undertaking any physical exercise if you have, or have had, any
medical problems or feel unwell or unfit. As yoga is very popular nowadays it should be relatively easy
to find a competent Yoga instructor in your local area who can advise you further and tailor your practice
to suit your level of health, suppleness and fitness. However, always remember that yoga is not about
pushing, straining and contorting the body un-naturally – each posture should be eased into slowly,
gracefully and gently, leaving the body feeling refreshed and invigorated – not worn out and aching. The
adage, ‘no pain, no gain’ has no place in the Ayurvedic Yoga system.
Following our instructions for balancing the breath (pranayama) and settling the mind (meditation) are
powerful ways to begin to experience profound levels of inner peace and harmony in a very short space of
time. These techniques are now widely accepted as scientifically valid ways to improve health and reduce
stress on a deep psychological level. Many large corporations, especially in the USA and Japan, have
trained their key staff in these skills to help them cope with the ever-increasing pressures of the modernday work environment whilst also improving their competitive edge and resourcefulness. Of course there
are side-effects – reduced weight, stronger digestion, increased immunity and a peaceful, relaxed mind.
In chapter three we introduce the concept of ‘the detox’. From an Ayurvedic standpoint the digestive
tract is often the primary source of illness and keeping it balanced and fully-functioning is of utmost
importance. Eating the right foods for your body-type with reference to the seasons is the first place to
start. However, especially in the west and especially in today’s fast-paced society, getting adequate
nutrition at the right time of day and in the right environment can be very difficult. To compound this,
the food we eat is often refined, processed and lacking in the essential nutrients we need to maintain, let
alone improve, our bodies. A ‘detox’ is designed to gently remove impurities from the body in a way that
works in harmony with it. Detoxing should be an enjoyable experience that should leave the body feeling
light, vibrant and full of energy –‘no pain, no gain’ has no part in Ayurveda. Struggle, strain and

un-natural diets will only imbalance the body further and should be avoided. Detox programs are best
done under the supervision of a qualified nutritionist but there is no harm in trying them yourself as long
as you stop as soon as you begin to experience any unpleasant ‘detoxing symptoms’ (headaches, nausea
etc).
We’ve also included an overview of some of the therapies that may be administered during Panchakarma
(an Ayurveda detox program). Ayurveda employs a wide range of powerful massage techniques to help
rectify imbalances within the physiology, many involving two technicians working in harmony on either
side of the body. Most Ayurvedic massages are luxuriously relaxing, to soothe the body and calm the
mind, while others are more stimulating, to energise the body and mobilise impurities. Treatment plans
are usually individually tailored, so whether you need to relax the mind or purify and revitalise the whole
body a suitable treatment package will be prescribed to help bring the body back into balance. However,
on a daily basis you can also carry out your own ‘mini-massage’ – it is simple to do and highly effective
in delaying the signs of aging, toning the skin and helping strengthen the immune system. This section
will also help you understand the benefits of improving your digestion and keeping your bowels cleansed
and healthy for optimum assimilation of nutrients.
As well as herbal oil massages, Panchakarma detox programs also utilise bastis; herbal oil enemas, which
scientific studies have shown to increase the effective elimination of impurities by up to sixty percent.
They are an essential component if you wish to lose weight, improve complexion or remove longstanding aches and pains from the muscles and joints. If you desire a flatter belly and a healthy glow
these are the key to success.
Chapter four contains a glossary of both Ayurvedic and western terminology used to describe the
properties of herb and essential oils. It also includes a list of herbal formulas and the conditions they can
be used for. Chapter five is dedicated to practical therapies and techniques you can do at home. There is
information on nasal cleansing, to unblock the sinuses, and advise on how to cope with allergies. There is
also information on joint problems and how they can be rectified, as well as some valuable information
and remedies for female related problems.
Chapter six gives practical advice for balancing the mind and resolving emotional conflicts. We’ve also
included a section on Thought Field Therapy , a powerful technique developed by Dr. Roger Challahan, a
clinical psychologist from the USA. By utilising this technique you can learn how to ‘tap’ some powerful
meridian points that can relieve some of life’s most stubborn obstacles to growth and development such
as phobias and fears.
We have included a chapter on mantra chanting for you to experiment with. Many of our clients have had
extraordinary results by introducing some of these mantras into their daily lives. We have also included a
section of our favourite recipes to give you some idea of the types of meals you can prepare using
ayurvedic principles. Each recipe provides a foundation on which you can experiment and adapt to your
own particular tastes. Many are these recipes are tri-doshic and therefore suitable for all body-types;
especially with the addition of churnas (herb and spice combinations).
Finally, we’ve included a selection of famous quotes and saying in which we hope you’ll find elements of
truth or inspiration relative to your own life path. We trust they will help motivate you move forward on
your journey towards a more fulfilling, more healthy, more joyous life.
The ‘Resources’ section, in the appendices, contains the website addresses for obtaining some of the
products, herbs, oils and supplements mentioned in this guide.

Ayurvedic body-types & nutrition
~ how to live in tune with our constitution & eat a healthy diet ~

Change is not something that we should fear.
Rather, it is something that we should welcome.
For without change, nothing in this world would ever grow or blossom,
and no one in this world would ever move forward
to become the person they’re meant to be.

The Body-Type Questionnaire
The body-type questionnaire that follows should be filled in to help ascertain your predominant
Ayurvedic dosha or body-type. Tick any attributes, abilities, conditions and states of mind or afflictions
that apply to you. If you are unsure about any of the questions you may wish to consult a friend who
knows you well and can perhaps be more objective. In reality the questionnaire is more likely to reveal
the particular doshas that are out of balance within your physiology. This is especially so if the bottom
half of the Vata, Pitta or Kapha questionnaire pages are ticked in preference to, or as well as, the top half.
For a more thorough understanding or your body-type it is best to consult an Ayurvedic practitioner who
will also read your pulse.
The questionnaire will also help you understand the traits and physical and mental characteristics of each
body-type. Each of us has a unique body-type, usually with one type (dosha) very prominent and one
close behind. Thus, a person with many Vata traits (lots of boxes ticked), fewer Pitta traits (less boxes
ticked) and very few Kapha traits (few boxes ticked) would be deemed a Vata/Pitta body-type. In this
example it could also be that the Vata traits show up mainly in the physical characteristics of the person
(right side of page) and the Pitta traits show up mainly in the mental or emotion side of the person (left
side of page). Each and every one of us has characterises of all three doshas in our physiology but one or
two of the doshas usually show up more predominantly.
Vata is composed of the elements of ether and air and governs the principle of movement and
communication in our physiology. Pitta is composed of the elements of fire and water and governs the
principle of energy and transformation in our physiology. It allows us to digest, absorb and assimilate
food, liquid and ideas. Kapha is composed of the elements of water and earth and governs the principle of
cohesion or structure. It is the ‘glue’ that holds or binds our physiology together.
It is our unique combination and percentage of each dosha; vata, pitta and kapha, that governs how we
interact with the rest of the relative universe. Our unique body-type gives us absolute individuality and
once we intimately understand, not only our own but other peoples, body-types we naturally behave more
tolerantly and become more gentle, more forgiving and less critical both of ourselves and others. With
this understanding comes not only the will and courage to adapt to our own strengths and weaknesses but
the ability to keep them in balance and functioning optimally.
Once you have filled in the body-type questionnaire and ascertained your unique Ayurvedic body-type
you can then follow the recommendations that follow to help stay balanced and healthy. If you have
ticked many of the boxes on the lower part of the vata, pitta or kapha questionnaire pages this indicates an
imbalance in that particular dosha. Even if this is not your predominant dosha (most ticks) you should
nevertheless balance this dosha first by following the recommendations for balancing that dosha.

Understanding Vata, Pitta & Kapha
Vata, pitta and Kapha are known as doshas in Ayurveda; they are the underlying principles that govern
the nature, transformation and structure of the physical universe. Each dosha is composed of two of the
five elements (ether, air, fire, water and earth) and it is the specific combination of these elements that
determines each doshas characteristic qualities and ultimately their overall effect in nature. Every object
in the natural world is composed of the elements of vata, pitta and kapha and it is the relative proportion
of each dosha or element that determines its uniqueness and differentiates it from another objects.
Vata is composed of the elements of air and space and its qualities are light, subtle, moving, cold, dry,
hard and rough. Vata governs movement in the mind and body. Pitta is composed of the elements of fire
and water and its qualities are hot, acidic, sour and sharp. Pitta governs transformation in the mind and
body, whether it’s the digestion, assimilation and metabolism of food and water into energy or the
digestion and assimilation of thoughts and ideas into actions. Kapha is composed of the elements of
earth and water and its qualities are heavy, cold, slow, binding, sticky and smooth. Kapha is responsible
for the density and structure of our body.
A person with a predominance of Vata dosha walks more quickly, has a lighter build and has colder and
dryer skin than someone with a predominance of Pitta or Kapha dosha in their constitution. Vata-type
people also tend to have very quick, agile minds and can be very creative. However, if their constitution
goes out of balance through excessive movement or irregularity they can suffer from feelings of
restlessness, boredom, fear, stress and anxiety. This may manifest in the body as poor circulation, cold
hands and feet, constipation and dry skin.
A person with more Pitta in their constitution has a hotter, fierier, more dynamic personality. They have
lots of energy, high ambitions, sharp intellects and good leadership qualities. However, if they go out of
balance and their innate ‘fire’ becomes too high they can quickly become angry, stressed and frustrated.
They generally have a strong digestive fire and immune system but when they slip out of balance they can
develop rashes, ulcers, acid stomachs and heart problems.
A person with a predominance of Kapha dosha in their constitution is generally slower, heavier, calmer
and more grounded than either Pitta or Vata. They are caring, loving, forgiving individuals with a placid,
easy-going nature. They have strong, solid bodies but can suffer from weight gain, lethargy and heaviness
when they are out of balance.
With an understanding of the qualities inherent in the elements that combine to make up the three doshas
we are able to keep the doshas in balance in our own bodies and thereby remain healthy, happy and free
from dis-ease. Any excessive increase in any of the qualities present in our doshic make-up will tend to
aggravate that dosha and will lead to imbalance. To decrease a quality we need to increase its opposite
quality. Thus, is we are a predominantly Vata body-type and we become excessively cold or are exposed
to noisy, busy environments with excess movement we will soon become imbalanced and un-grounded.
If we immediately introduce the opposite qualities of warmth or calmness and quietness we will soon
bring ourselves back into a grounded, more balanced state. Similarly, for a Pitta person, who has a
predominance of heat, the opposing quality of coldness will bring them back into balance. A Kapha
person, who has a predominance of heaviness, will be balanced by the opposing quality of lightness.
I hope the next piece ‘The dosha family go shopping’ will help you to understand how extreme Vata, Pitta
and Kapha body-type people conduct their lives!

The Dosha family go shopping
Characters: Mr Kapha Dosha, Mrs Pitta Dosha, Master Vata Dosha
It’s a lovely sunny morning in the beautiful village of Toadbury where the Dosha family are beginning to
go about their daily business. Mr Kapha Dosha has volunteered to do the shopping whilst Mrs Pitta Dosha
tidies the house ready for the arrival of their friends later that day. Master Vata Dosha isn’t quite sure
what he’s going to do on this particular day but he’s rather tired as he’s spent most of the night worrying
about the gig he’s managed to pull off at the Three Shires Inn later that evening. He’s busy tuning his
guitar but his mind just won’t settle and he’s afraid that his debut at this important venue will be a
complete flop.
In typical Kapha fashion Mr Dosha has woken late again and is still eating his breakfast at 10am. He
listens patiently to his wife as she rapidly reels off the shopping list – he’s a little distracted by their cat,
Pretty Polly, who’s in the garden trying to stalk a beady-eyed Blackbird. However, he nods politely and is
thankful she’s written it all down as usual. He agrees to be back by 11’o’ clock at the latest but hasn’t any
idea what the time is anyway as he’s misplaced his watch again for the fourth time in a week. As he steps
out of the house he’s pleasantly amused by the duelling duo again – the cat is now looking rather angry
and slightly embarrassed as the Blackbird she’s just attempted to pounce upon has decided to put an end
to the silly game. She’d cautiously manoeuvred into her final approach and was all ready to pounce,
confident of a delicious reward. However, the Blackbird was keenly aware of the cat’s presence and at the
last moment had nonchalantly flown to the top of the garage roof, sung a melodious wee tune and then
swooped so low over Pretty Polly that she has to duck for cover and almost fell in the goldfish pond in the
process.
Mr Kapha laughs heartily and takes a seat by the garden shed to lap up some of the morning sun. He
listens to the Robins and Linnets, gazes at the Swallows and Swifts catching flies above him and sighs
deeply as aromas from the honey-scented roses gently drift over on the light, warm breeze. He feels a
deep gratitude and contentment and gradually dozes off in the sun blissfully unaware of his angry wife
approaching. She strides purposefully towards him, her ginger hair flowing wildly behind her. He wakes
abruptly, senses the urgency in her angry reproach as he remembers his shopping duty and makes his way
to the car. He settles into the car seat, adjusting it slightly to accommodate his somewhat corpulent build,
puts on some music and slowly backs the car into the street. As he lazily makes his way to the shops his
mind is still in the garden, soaking up the sun and smelling the fresh roses. He finds a convenient parking
space, realises he’s forgotten the shopping list and strolls to the precinct via his favourite park with the
large pink and red Rhododendrons and majestic Cedar trees.
He can’t resist the sweet, homely smells of the bakery and stops off to buy some doughnuts. He ambles
into the supermarket and is immediately tempted by the fascinating array of meats and cheeses at the deli
counter. He chooses a few and tries to remember what Mrs Pitta Dosha had on her shopping list. He
wishes he’d remembered it – she’d typed it out very neatly and even arranged it in order of the rows in the
store. However, he does the best he can and makes his way home laden with all manner of ‘goodies’ he
feels will please his guests.
His wife has finished all the housework in record time and has even tidied his office and trimmed the
bushes in the front garden. However, she’s none too pleased at his late return and can’t imagine why on
earth it’s taken three hours to do a tiny bit of shopping and how in the Lord’s name he could lose the car
in such a small town. On finding he’s forgotten to buy almost half the groceries on her list she flies off

7

into a rage again and slams the door so hard that even the windows in the garden shed rattle a little. She
screeches tyres as she zooms out onto the street and is at the shops in ten minutes flat. She parks neatly
near the entrance of the supermarket, clears sweet packets and chocolate wrappers out of the car into a
nearby rubbish-bin and hurries to the isles. She methodically marches down one isle after another, rapidly
ticking off all the items on her list. She jumps the queue at the fast checkout, packs the food in the boot of
the car and charges off to the printers to collect some business cards she ordered several weeks before. On
her way home she gets the car washed at the local garage, selects some choice flowers to brighten the
living room from the tree nursery and calls in at the hairdressers to check her appointment for later that
day. She’s home within an hour and quickly unpacks the car before making a quick salad for lunch.
Meanwhile Master Vata Dosha has been searching his chaotic room for the song sheets he’s been
working on for weeks. He finally finds it half-hidden, torn and crumbled under a tee-shirt amongst all the
dirty jeans and piles of books by the bathroom door. He’s still undecided as to the most appropriate order
of play and is completely at a loss regarding whether or not to start with his own song. He’s been told
repeatedly that it’s very good but he thinks that perhaps another song – one that everybody will almost
certainly love and be able to identify with would be better. In the frantic flurry of searching he’s managed
to knock over his guitar and broken a couple of strings which has stressed him even further as he’s
forgotten to buy any spares.
He asks his Dad if he can borrow the car, half hears the answer and rushes out of the front door. He jumps
in the car, knocks the side mirror in passing and then realises he hasn’t got any car-keys. He grabs them
from the sideboard and hurries out of the house again and then almost runs over the cat as he backs the
car out of the driveway. Finally, he stalls the engine as he hits the kerbs on the other side of the road. His
erratic driving warrants the attention of a few rather more cautious drivers and their ‘honking’ and handsignals agitates him even further.
Once in town he parks haphazardly near the music store and forgets to lock the car. Once in the shop he
grabs the guitar strings he needs and then quickly dashes back to the car for his wallet. He fiddles with the
remote key fob and is more than a little confused when he finds the car is now locked but presses the
remote control once again and unlocks it. In his haste he bangs the car mirror back into place but scuffs
his new suede shoes on the kerb as he narrowly misses knocking over a postman.
On his way home he realises he’s forgotten to pick up the hair gel he’d intended to buy and turns the car
round. His usual supplier is completely out so he’s heads to the next village which is also where his friend
Joe lives. After picking up some gel and shampoo he heads to Joe’s but then realises Joe needs the song
sheets which are back at home. He turns round and heads home only to realise that he’s almost out of fuel
and needs to make a detour to find a garage. He finally arrives home; flies upstairs, grabs the song-sheets
and heads back to Joe’s. Joe’s not in and he’s forgotten to bring his mobile and as Joe’s number is on the
mobile he has no way of finding out where he is. He decides to drive home again and try again later. As
he pulls into the driveway he recognises Joe’s car and suddenly remembers he had arranged to meet him
at 2pm. He scratches the door of his Dad’s car on the wall as he gets out and apologises profusely to his
friend for being late.
Joe has brought a new tape and it plays soothingly in the background, his mother has made him his
favourite cup of Chamomile tea and his father has finally got round to typing out his song sheets and
determined the right order of play. His mind settles and he relaxes briefly. His mother takes a relaxingly
cool shower, makes herself some peppermint tea and then practices some yoga and meditation for twenty
minutes. His father, after much procrastination, goes to their gym in the basement and plays some Wagner
while he exercises for half an hour. By four pm all is settled and peaceful at the Dosha household and
order is restored once again.

Vata Dosha
Vata governs all movement in the mind and body. It controls the flow of blood, the elimination of waste
products, the act of breathing and the movement of thoughts in the mind. It is considered the leader of the
three doshas (energies or energetic principles in the body) as Pitta and Kapha cannot move or exist
without it. It is therefore imperative that Vata is brought back into balance whenever it is disturbed.
You need to balance the movement of Vata if many of the following conditions are present:
• Your skin or hair is dry, rough and thin.
• You feel cold easily or have poor circulation with cold hands and feet.
• You are chronically underweight and find it difficult to gain weight.
• Your mind is constantly anxious, restless and agitated and you are prone to worry and fear.
• You experience constipation or have frequent flatulence.
• You suffer from insomnia or have unsettled sleep and disturbing dreams.
• You suffer from vaginal dryness or menstrual cramps and PMT.
• You have spells of forgetfulness and absent mindedness.
• You experience discomfort or stiffness in the joints or lower back pain.
• You easily become fatigued and have poor endurance.

geranium, lavender, basil, spruce & fir are excellent in this regard.
Maintain a regular daily routine by integrating the ‘Daily Routine’ (see later section).
Give yourself an Abhyanga massage using warm sesame oil each morning.
Ensure you have regular, daily elimination. Triphala herbal formula helps in this regard.
Stay warm, especially in cold, windy weather.
Take gentle walks in the countryside to calm and balance the mind.
Wear calm, soothing colours such as pastels, green or brown.
Do not overexert and rest whenever the body becomes tired or over stimulated
Relax often by practicing meditation, pranayama, Yoga or Tai Chi.
Chant ‘Ram’ (pronounced ‘rarm’) 108 times each day.
Read light, humorous, feel-good novels and turn the television off one hour before bed.
Take up walking, fishing, bird-watching or gardening for general relaxation.
Take up writing, drawing, painting or acting to balance your creative energies.
Avoid excessive talking and try to have a day of silence each week.
Wrap up warm and keep dry in the winter - cover your head on cold, windy days.
Avoid loud, noisy environments
Rest for short periods throughout the day
Avoid excessive use of VDU displays

Favour warm, hearty, nourishing foods with added butter/oil – favour salty, sour and sweet tastes.
Try and reduce light, dry, cold foods and pungent, bitter and astringent tastes
Hot, milky, creamy cereals (wheat, oatmeal or rice), soups and stews are all very good for pacifying Vata.
All dairy products are good (ideally organic and unpasturised) – milk should always be boiled first.
Oils are good but favour ghee, coconut oil, olive oil, Udo’s oil, flax/pumpkin oil and sesame oil.
Reduce your intake of light, dry, cold foods such as crackers, nuts, seeds and salads.
Take nuts and seeds in small quantities only – they are best freshly ground with oil added.
Reduce the intake of all bean products except tofu, mung beans, mung dhal and red lentils.
The best grains are rice and wheat but you can take barley, corn, millet, buckwheat, rye and oats in moderation.
Favour stewed and well ripened, sweet or sour fruits but reduce the intake of dry or light fruits such as apples, pears,
pomegranates, cranberries, and dried fruits (if uncooked). Dried fruits are good if they are cooked after soaking
overnight.
Sweeteners are good (in moderation), especially jaggary, honey, maple syrup and algarve.
Vegetables should be cooked and not raw. Peas, green leafy vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower, celery,
zucchini and potatoes are acceptable in moderate quantities if they are cooked, especially with Ghee or oil
and Vata reducing spices but it is best to avoid sprouts and cabbage.
Hot, nourishing desserts such as apple pie help pacify Vata.
Eat a substantial breakfast to help improve energy levels throughout the day.
Herbal teas (camomile, fennel, basil) with a few digestive biscuits are good for Vata energy slumps.
Avoid stimulants such as coffee and alcohol.
Sip hot water throughout the day to flush out impurities and balance Vata.
Warm milk flavoured with ghee, cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg is excellent before bed.

Pitta Dosha
Pitta dosha is made up of the elements of fire and water through which it manifests the qualities of pungent, hot,
penetrating, oily, sharp, liquid, spreading and sour. Its primary function is transformation and is the force of
metabolic activity in the body associated with the endocrine function, digestion, body temperature, visual
perception, hunger, thirst, and skin quality. In Western terms we can categorise the activities of pitta in terms of
amino acids, enzymes, bile, hydrochloric acid and hormones. This explains the seemingly contradictory
combination of fire and water to form pitta. Pitta exists as water or oil in the body, thus preserving the tissues
from the destructive aspect of fire. It resides in the eyes, blood, sweat glands and lymph but its primary site is in
the small intestine. Mentally it plays a role in understanding, in digesting sensory impressions.
You need to balance the heat of pitta if many of the following conditions are present:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Your skin is overly oily and prone to acne.
You are prone to rashes, fevers or inflammatory skin conditions
You have excessive hunger or thirst.
You sweat profusely and have overly hot hands and feet.
You suffer from infections, access acidity, ulcers and heart problems.
You are overly aggressive and prone to anger and frustration.
You experience lose or hot, watery stools and diarrhoea-type elimination.
You tend to be overly critical, domineering, obsessive or controlling in nature.
You experience frequent eyestrain or tension headaches.
You are going prematurely grey or balding.

Follow a Pitta balancing diet and avoid overly hot, spicy or sour foods.
Avoid very heating substances such as red meat, alcohol and tobacco.
Avoid excessive fasting and try to eat when you are hungry. Don’t skip meals; especially lunch.
Exercise moderately (short runs or swims) and only when the weather or climate is cool.
Walk regularly in nature; especially by the sea. Walking in the moonlight is also very beneficial.
Especially avoid prolonged exercise in very hot climates or environments.
Keep your head and skin protected and refrain from sunbathing when the sun is hot.
Reduce your exposure to hot environments such as saunas and steam rooms.
Cultivate peaceful emotions and spend more time with people who love and fully accept you.
Avoid and angry or stressed people and try not to argue – aim to agree more often!
Take the time to be sweet and sociable and find the time to chat, laugh and play.
Practice moderation and find time for enjoying leisure activities and appreciating natural beauty.
Avoid overly competitive sports, deadlines and confrontation in general.
Practice meditation, cooling forms of pranayama and gentle yoga postures.
Avoid watching too much television and excessive use of computers.
Massage the head with coconut oil at night.
Wear cooling colours – blue, purple, green and avoid wearing red colours.
Drink pomegranate juice or eat pomegranate seeds. Its astringent and bitter quality helps balance pitta,
cleanses the liver and blood and works as an excellent heart tonic.
Drink 30mls of Aloe Vera each morning.

Favour warm to hot foods that are light and dry in quality. They should be cooked with minimal fat and
water and be predominantly pungent, bitter and astringent in taste.
Spicy Indian or Mexican food is good for Kapha as long as not too much oil is used in cooking.
Avoid heavy, oily and cold foods and foods that have predominantly sweet, sour and salty tastes.
Drink 1 litre of hot water with lemon and/or ginger daily. Have barley tea or post-digestive tea after main
meals to cleanse the tissues, improve digestion, give energy and reduce hunger.
Favour baked, grilled or sautéed food in preference to boiled, deep-fried or steamed food.
Occasional have small side salads and raw foods to help tone the digestive tract.
Avoid fried foods and cold cereals at breakfast – stewed fruit or toast with honey is much better.
Favour barley, buckwheat, quinoa, amaranth, corn, millet and rye and limit oats, rice and wheat. Dry
roasting grains in ghee before cooking helps make them lighter on the digestion.
Increase your intake of vegetables but exclude mashed potatoes, turnips and parsnips.
Lighter fruits, such as apples and pears are better for Kapha. Reduce heavy or sour fruits, such as oranges,
bananas, pineapples, figs, dates, avocados, coconuts and melons.
Honey is excellent for reducing Kapha but generally reduce other sugar products.
Spices are all fine but reduce salt as it helps retain water and increases Kapha.
Limit your intake of milk, butter, ice-cream, biscuits, cakes, chocolate, deep-fried food, white sugar,
aspartame, tinned beans, fizzy drinks, yeasted bread, confectionary, sweet fruits, red meat, potatoes, hard
or aged cheeses, salt and alcohol.
Avoid low-fat products as these are highly processed and usually high in sugar.
Have rice cakes, rye bread, chapattis and corn bread rather then yeast-risen bread.
Pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds and walnuts are good but they should be lightly roasted and then
ground before eating.
Most beans are good as long as they are well cooked.

More on balancing kapha
to reduce excess weight
By balancing the kapha energetic principle in our body we will not only reduce excess fat and water but will also
increase energy levels, enable the endocrine and digestive system to function better, and create a more youthful
appearance. The key factor is to balance digestion as this will help to reduce cravings and normalise appetite.
A Kapha-related weight imbalance is due to a lack of digestive fire (low agni) and low metabolic rate so even
though we may eat very small amounts of food, we still tend to gain weight. With this type of imbalance
digestive impurities are being created, fat tissue is accumulating in the body and the formation of bone tissue is
slowed down due to accumulation of fat tissue. The solution is to increase the metabolic rate and burn up the
impurities.
When excess weight accumulates, it blocks nutrient circulation and can aggravate Pitta. This results in excess
acid, excess thirst, irritability and an intense appetite for sweet, heavy, cooling foods — the very kind of foods
that cause us to gain weight to begin with. The solution is to drink herbalised water containing small amounts of
fenugreek, coriander and fennel throughout the day. Fenugreek burns fat and helps absorption, coriander
eliminates toxins, and fennel helps with digestion. To make the water, boil one litre of water and pour into a
thermos. Add half a teaspoon of ground fenugreek, half a teaspoon of whole coriander seeds and half a teaspoon
of fennel seeds. Drink throughout the day. A mixture of one part ground turmeric, two parts ground cumin, three
parts ground coriander and four parts ground fennel should be added to vegetables or legumes during cooking to
help balance digestion, assimilation and stomach acid.
Exercise is one of the main activities that will help to burn ama and increases circulation and metabolism so an
hour of walking, dancing, swimming or light weight training each day will help enormously.
Emotional stress is another key factor in kapha imbalances and weight gain and can manifest as eating when you
are not hungry or looking for something sweet to pacify a bad mood. Walking in nature, meditation, yoga and
pranayama will all help with this situation as will massage and herbalised steam therapies.
Patience is also one of the key factors when attempting to balance Kapha. Kapha moves slowly so follow as
many of the recommendations as you can and be confident that your body will gradually respond. Some people
respond almost immediately but others may not see drastic changes for many months. However, once the
blockages are cleared and the digestion is strong the weight will begin to fall away naturally and quite rapidly.
This is not designed to be a fast method to shed pounds but a holistic approach from which you will see
satisfying results gradually. Once you have built up your digestive fire and the metabolic processes are balanced,
your diet can be more flexible.
On the following page is a list of the most important recommendations for balancing kapha and shedding excess
weight. Some of the terms and procedures may be unfamiliar at this point but they will all be explained later in
the book.

Follow a ‘Kapha reducing’ diet.
Arise around dawn (5-6am) as this increases energy levels and helps reduce ama or toxins.
Drink a cup of hot water with a slice of lemon on rising in the morning to cleanse the digestive tract of
metabolic waste products.
Massage your head vigorously with coconut oil each morning to sharpen the senses and nourish and
strengthen your hair.
Skin-brush your body each morning to improve blood circulation and help eliminate toxins.
Massage under your rib cage with a little sesame oil to help improve digestion.
Practice ‘Belly Breath’ (see ‘pranayama’ section).
Practice fast pranayama ‘huh-huh-huh’ and chi-uh-ha’ sounds (see section on ‘healing sounds’) to
increase energy levels, balance the mind, tone the belly and improve digestion.
Exercise (jog, swim or cycle) and practice some yoga each morning and evening.
Practice meditation (20 mins am and pm) to improve mental clarity and increase energy levels.
Have a ten-minute steam-inhalation session once or twice a week with eucalyptus essential oil. Boil
some water and place in a sink or bowl, add a drop of oil, place a towel over your head and gently
breathe in the steam. This especially good if you have blocked sinuses or respiratory allergies.
Use a Neti Pot* with tepid saline water each morning (see section on ‘using a Neti pot’). This is also
good for reducing congestion in the head and sinuses.
Use Nasya drops* (two in each nostril) each morning to ease sinus congestion, help prevent colds and
heighten dull senses.
Do not skip meals and eat only when hungry. Eat your largest meal at mid-day and only have a light,
easily digestible supper (soup etc). Do not eat after 7pm.
Take ginger pickle (see recipe section) before each main meal to improve digestion.
Drink fresh, organic, homemade carrot (10oz), beetroot (3oz) and cucumber (3oz) juice (total of 16oz)
with 1-2 tsp Udo’s oil for breakfast. Alternative juices include: carrot (10oz) and spinach (6oz) or carrot
(11oz) and cabbage (5oz). These can also be taken mid-morning and/or mid-afternoon.
Decrease your intake of heavy, saturated fats but increase your intake of healthy fats such as flax, hemp,
pumpkin or Udo’s oil (1-2 tsp daily). This will help reduce food cravings, lower cholesterol and
regulate the appetite. Use these oils on vegetables and salads and as salad dressings. However, do not
use for cooking or frying but favour minimal amounts of ghee or coconut oil instead.
Avoid commercial protein powder drinks. Instead eat live protein filled with the intelligence of nature
from almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, sesame seeds and pumpkin seeds. These should be
soaked overnight and ground just before eating (use an equal mix and take two teaspoons per day..
Have a fluid day each week (see ‘mini detox’ section – this can be a juice fast or a soup fast). You can
follow the rounding program described later in this book for extra benefits.
Follow a 3-5 day ‘Master Cleanse’ (see relevant section later in book) every few months.
Take Triphala tablets* (2-3) before bedtime to cleanse the digestive tract.
Alternatively take Guggul Plus* to help reduce cholesterol and excess weight and Punarnava Plus* to
help with water retention.
Take Chywanaprash* (a.k.a. Amrit Kalash) twice a day as an immune system booster. It is very high in
vitamin C and other anti-oxidants.

A balanced diet & the six tastes
SWEET
SOUR
SALT
PUNGENT
BITTER
ASTRINGENT

Sugar, milk, butter, ghee, sweet fruit, bread, pasta, grains
Yoghurt, lemon, vinegar, wine, soy sauce, grapefruit, aged cheese
Salt (also in vegetables; especially celery and seaweeds)
Hot, spicy foods such as pepper, ginger, garlic, cayenne, chilli
Leafy greens, olives, turmeric, horseradish, turmeric, fenugreek, nettle, lettuce, aloe
Beans, lentils, dhal, honey, rhubarb, apples, leafy greens, pomegranate, sprouts

The tongue has taste buds which register all the above six tastes. If the body receives all these tastes in each
meal it feels satisfied and will not overeat or feel hungry again soon after eating. However, there are far more
taste buds that register the sweet as opposed to astringent or sour taste. This is because we do not require equal
amounts of each taste. There are more ‘sweet’ taste buds because this is the taste we require the most of; sweet
tasting foods, such as rice and milk, are nourishing and give us protein, energy and vitality. They are heavy and
grounding and are required by Vata types much more than Kapha types.
Bitter tasting foods supply many vitamins, enzymes and minerals. They are also detoxifying, reduce water
retention and are good as tonics for the liver and blood. Most are cleansing and help take away burning and
itching sensations. In excess they can aggravate vata and dehydrate the body. Astringent tasting foods are also
diuretic and blood purifiers. They help balance pitta and kapha but in excess can create gas and constipation.
Spices are certainly a quick, convenient and flavourful way of incorporating the more unusual bitter and
astringent tastes. Salt helps the body retain water and maintains substance and grounding, whilst pungent and
sour tasting foods burn up toxins and stimulate the digestion.
As different body-types require different quantities of each taste we must allow our own innate intelligence to
determine what combinations it requires in terms of optimum nutrition, especially since this may change on a
daily and/or seasonal basis. Our limited modern model of nutrition is continually being updated and adapted as
we discover new groups of molecules (such as vitamins, minerals enzymes and proteins) that our body requires
to function optimally. It then struggles to determine the appropriate amount of each vitamin, mineral, enzyme or
protein our bodies require and in what combinations they should be taken in. The debate will probably go on
forever as there are so many variables to consider. However, Ayurveda has a simple solution – simply accept
that our own body knows intuitively and instinctively just what it needs at any particular moment. It relays its
message through our desire for particular taste combinations and we should follow those impulses for maximum
health. Of course, to be sure that these signals are getting through we need to remain relaxed, balanced and fully
aware. The life-style recommendations in this book are designed to facilitate this process.
To summarise: the only effective way to reduce the amount of food you eat and to cut down on unhealthy
cravings is to include all six tastes in every meal. Furthermore, these six tastes are not required in equal amounts
but should be combined in proportions to suit your particular body type.
Vata body-types: Generally require more sweet, sour and salty tastes especially in winter or if stressed. Meals
should also be heavy, warm, oily and nourishing (soups and stews are good).
Pitta body-types: Generally require more sweet, bitter and astringent tastes especially in summer. Food should
also be slightly heavy and oily and small cold dishes may be included.
Kapha body-types: Generally require more bitter, astringent and pungent tastes, especially in spring or if feeling
heavy, lethargic or dull minded. Food should also be light, dry and warm to aid digestion and heavy, oily foods
and dairy products should be excluded.

Improving digestion & maintaining health
In the west the majority of people suffer from everyday digestion problems such as gas, bloating,
stomach pain, constipation, heartburn, and fatigue after eating. Ayurveda provides simple solutions to
these common complaints by considering not only what we eat but how we consume our meals.
To ensure food is properly digested, assimilated and metabolised by the body it is important to follow
these guidelines:
•

Eat at the times when the body has the necessary enzymes available to cope with the digestion of food.
The peak time for enzymatic production is mid-day and this is the time to eat the largest meal of the
day. By ensuring that the heaviest foods and largest quantities are eaten at this time, the bodily tissues
are able to fully utilise the nutritional value of foods consumed. This helps reduce the amount of food
required by the body and reduces food cravings between meals. It also goes a long way to helping
reduce weight and maintaining hormone balance. The evening meal should be light as the body
produces far less enzymes to help digest food at this period of the day. You should aim to eat at least
three hours before going to bed and this should therefore be between 5-7pm.
Have you ever gone out for a late dinner and found that it was a strain to wake up the next morning or
that it was difficult to be efficient during the following day? These are often the side effects of
improperly digested food. The best way to avoid these problems is to follow nature's prescription of
suitable times to eat. When the sun is strongest the digestive fire is also strongest. Agni is associated
with the Sun. This is one of the ways ayurveda seeks to connect our mind and body with the
environment. As the sun goes down so does our agni. Late night meals interfere with sleep and after
10:00 p.m. the body is working to burn off toxins and continue to digest food from the day. If you eat
after 10:00 p.m., the food may cause toxins to accumulate in the system, and as a result the next day
you wake up tired. If you are not able to wake up fresh and clear, then it is important to analyze the
quantity of food and the time of night you are eating dinner.

•

Each meal should be taken in a peaceful, pleasant environment and should not be consumed when
irritated, angry or stressed as this hinders the digestive process and leads to bloating, gas and the buildup of toxins in the gut. Excessive talk or a noisy environment hinders the digestion and leads to
undigested food remaining in the body causing wind and bloating. Watching television or reading
during eating can also have similar effects. Our bodies need an uplifting and settled environment in
order to process and absorb the nutrients from our meals. If that is not available then we should at least
be sitting down to eat - not standing, walking or driving. The act of eating is life-giving. The process of
eating, according to ayurveda, is something reverent and important for the development of
consciousness as well as our physical health. When we sit down to eat our stomach is in a relaxed
posture and our awareness is on the taste, texture, and smell of the food. This will greatly improve the
digestion.

•

Whilst it is important to drink between 1-2 litres of water per day, liquid should not be consumed half
an hour before or one hour after eating as this ensures that the digestive enzymes responsible for
digesting food aren’t diluted by excessive water intake. It is, however, useful to sip small amounts of
hot water with a meal as this aids the digestive process. Ayurveda recommends taking a small cup of
‘Post-digestive’ tea (see ‘herbal teas’) to help with the digestive process. Hot water with fresh ginger,
lemon, fennel seeds or mint leaves should be sipped throughout the day.

•

The next ayurvedic recommendation also addresses agni. Ayurveda recommends avoiding cold drinks
at meals and ice cold foods in general. This is like putting cold water on the burning logs. Iced water,

18

normally served at restaurants, extinguishes the digestive fire. Even juice or milk right out of the
refrigerator is too cold for the digestion. Juice should be taken at room temperature and water without
ice. Once you get into this habit of drinking beverages at room temperature you will notice a dramatic
improvement in your digestion and the way your body feels while eating and after the meal. Cold drinks
and foods mixed with warm cooked foods can cause stomach cramps, bloating and general discomfort
in the stomach area. If you have a pitta imbalance you can take cool drinks in-between meals. Cold or
frozen foods are not recommended for pitta either because even though they may temporarily cool
down the heat, the agni is still being over stimulated and the imbalance will continue. Try slightly cool
drinks made with rose water, or milk blended with dates or fresh mangos.
•

Avoid caffeine, alcohol and carbonated soft drinks and switch to life-giving, vitality-boosting
beverages. Water, that most basic yet most overlooked elixir of life, helps to rehydrate the system and
flushes toxins from the body. Water that has been boiled and cooled has the added healing element of
fire in it. Adding herbs and spices suited to your physiology or designed to correct a specific imbalance
can enhance the healing quality of the water you drink. At bedtime, drink a cup of warm milk (boil and
cool it for added digestibility) blended with a spoonful of ghee, a pinch of ginger, a pinch of cardamom
and a pinch of nutmeg will aid sleep.

•

Cut down on sugar, wheat, coffee, tea, alcohol and red meat as these hinder the digestive process, leach
nutrients and water from the body or block the uptake of nutrients from food. This is especially so with
sugar as this ‘feeds’ the ‘bad’ bacteria in the gut and helps them multiply – this leads to candida,
bloating, wind and indigestion.

•

Another way to improve the digestion is to stimulate the agni or digestive fire before we begin eating.
Weak digestive agni may result in fatigue after eating so Ayurveda recommends eating a one inch piece
of fresh ginger with a few drops of lemon juice and a few pinches of salt on it before a full meal. This
starts to activate the salivary glands, producing the necessary enzymes so that the nutrients in the food
are easily absorbed by the body. See ‘Ginger Pickle’ recipe.
Balancing your digestive agni is a key principle in Ayurvedic medicine. That's why ayurveda
recommends a number of general practices for better digestion. Digestive agni can be compared to a
burning fire. If the flame is very low than it will take a long time to cook the food. In the same way if
the fire is too big it can burn the food. If we put a huge log on a low fire it will extinguish it. Our
digestive fires should be balanced so that we can digest our meals efficiently and smoothly.

•

Ideally, each main meal should provide the six tastes of bitter, sweet, pungent, astringent, sour and
salty. This ensures the nutritional requirements of the body are met and reduces the need for snacking
and over-eating. Specific mixtures of herbs or ‘churna’s’ may be added during cooking or sprinkled
over food to ensure a balance of the six tastes in each meal (see ‘churna’ recipes). Spices not only add
flavour and aroma; they also bring therapeutic value to the meal. They help boost natural immunity, and
most of them boost the digestion so that the body is better able to absorb and assimilate the nutrients
from the foods you eat.

•

Start the day with a stewed apple and raisins as this is light, warm and nourishing and breaks the fast of
the night slowly. The digestive system needs warm, nourishing foods in the morning to stimulate it, but
not too much. The digestive fire is just waking up, and will be at full capacity when the sun is high in
the sky, at noon. Heavier proteins and larger amounts of food are best digested later in the day. A
stewed apple also helps your elimination system, because it is easy to digest and contains lots of fibre.
It also contains vitamins, trace minerals, and antioxidants. This is also a good recommendation for
weight loss as anything that is light on the digestion, and adds nutrients rather than empty calories,
helps burn body fat.

19

•

It is important not to eat if there is no hunger/appetite present. Often the feeling of ‘needing something’
to eat is really a need for liquid intake – try and listen to the body’s signals. Often the body needs
smaller, easily digestible soups and fruit/vegetable juices rather than a ‘full-blown’ meal, to gain energy
and vitality.

•

Eat slowly and always chew your food well - many digestive enzymes are added from the salivary
glands and these are stimulated by the action of the jaw. Food that enters the stomach should be ‘soup
like’ as the stomach has no teeth to do this for you.

•

At the end of a meal it is beneficial to wait for five minutes before taking seconds or a desert as this
gives the body time to register fullness and to indicate whether it requires more. You should leave the
table feeling light, refreshed and energetic. It you feel heavy and tired after eating this is an indication
that you have eaten too much or that the food you ate was nutritionally poor. Allow five to ten minutes
before leaving the table and then take a short walk for ten to fifteen minutes to aid the digestive process.

•

Food consumed should always be of the highest quality. Fresh, organic food is best and all refined,
processed food is best avoided. Colour, taste and presentation are as important as nutritional content as
the pleasure we get from smelling, seeing and tasting food determines the abundance of enzymes
necessary for proper digestion.

•

If raw foods are eaten these should be taken at the beginning of the meal and always in small quantities
(less than one third of the total meal content). Whilst raw food contains an abundance of vitamins and
enzymes the body finds it harder to break these down than cooked food and this can lead to severe
digestive problems, especially if the body is already under stress and the digestion is working less than
optimally. The best cooking method is to lightly steam vegetables as this ensures minimal loss of
enzymes and maximum retention of nutrients.

•

According to Ayurveda sweet, fruit deserts should be taken at the beginning of a meal rather than at the
end. Sweet tastes satisfy hunger and quench the appetite and therefore reduce the need for large
amounts of food. Fruit that is left sitting behind the main meal waiting to be digested (up to six hours)
can ferment and produce large amounts of gas and bloating. This destroys the ‘good’ digestive flora
and encourages the production of ‘bad’ digestive flora/bacteria.

•

To properly digest a meal the stomach should be no more than a third full. A third should contain food,
a third the liquid you have been consuming before the meal and a third air or space. This allows the
digestive juices to fully break down the food contained there.

•

Another ayurvedic tip for digestion is to drink a fresh yogurt drink called Lassie either during or after
the meal. This drink consists of 1/4 cup fresh homemade yogurt, 1 cup room temperature water and
sugar to taste. Blend it for one minute in the blender. Lassie is light and contains lactobacilli, necessary
bacteria that lubricate the intestines to help digestion go smoothly. Lassie drinks help to reduce gas and
bloating. They also taste delicious and can make a meal more satisfying and nutritious. See ‘lassie’
recipes.

•

Adequate intake of essential fatty acids (omega 3,6,9) will help reduce cholesterol, high blood pressure,
diabetes and obesity. These can be found is fresh deep-sea fish such as mackerel, sardines and salmon
and in many freshly-ground nuts and seeds. However, the best way to ensure an adequate intake is by
adding oil to your food. Olive oil is good but flax oil, pumpkin oil and borage oil are better. Better still
is a specially formulated blend called ‘Udo’s oil’ (see ‘Savant’ in the resources section) which contains
all the essential fatty acids or omegas in their ideal ratios for optimum health and nutrition.

20

•

Fruits and vegetables contain lots of phyto-nutrients, and a variety of senses-pleasing colours, tastes and
textures. Ayurveda has always recommended eating lots of fruits and vegetables, not only for their
nutritional value, but also because they are natural internal cleansers. Modern research concurs that
fruits and vegetables are powerful disease-prevention foods - in fact, it is now recommended that you
eat nine servings of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables a day to prevent cancer and other free radical
induced diseases.

•

Eat naturally intelligent foods. Almost three-quarters of the products sold in supermarkets contain
genetically modified ingredients and many of the chemicals and pesticides used in growing foods have
been linked to numerous diseases. Processed foods, genetically modified foods, and foods to which
additives or artificial preservatives have been added are no longer alive with the intelligence of nature.
According to ayurveda, the human physiology is a reflection of the laws of the universe, and the more
in tune our lives are with nature, the healthier we are likely to be. Our digestive system is designed to
process foods that are closest to nature - whole grains, pulses, fruits and vegetables. Help your
digestion function optimally by choosing organic foods whenever possible - your health is worth the
extra cost.

•

Cook your food correctly. The purpose of ayurvedic cooking is to combine the intelligence of the
spices, the intelligence of vegetables and the intelligence of the fat - all the different enzymes and
energetics - in a way that is not confusing for your body's intelligence to break down and incorporate.
Ayurvedic cooking methods are easy on the digestive system. You can prepare ayurvedic vegetables in
one of two ways. The first way is to steam the vegetables and then add the spices which have been
sautéed in ghee, coconut oil or olive oil. The second way is to sauté the spices in ghee, coconut oil or
olive oil and to then add the vegetables and sauté for a few minutes. Cover and cook at low
temperature. If you are making a curry (vegetables with sauce), add a small amount of water to finish
cooking the vegetables

•

Give your digestive system a break. According to ayurveda, the build up of ama or toxins in the
physiology is the root cause of most disorders. That's why ayurveda recommends internal cleansing at
the change of each season for optimal health. During internal cleansing, eat light yet nourishing foods
such as mung bean soup or kicharee and drink lots of warm water or ‘Detox Tea’ through the day. See
‘teas’ in recipe section. Fresh, sweet juicy fruits are excellent cleansers. Periodic internal cleansing gets
rid of accumulated junk from inside the body and boosts the digestion for the next season.

•

Triphala is an excellent aid to elimination and purification and will help strengthen and purify the
digestive/immune system. It is best taken in the late evening. A herbal paste called Chywanaprash is
also excellent in this regard.

•

Water is essential for good, digestion, ridding the body of toxins, maintaining immunity and healthy
skin. When the water is herbalised it has an even stronger, more beneficial action.
For kapha types: To a thermos of boiled water, add 2 thin slices of fresh ginger root, 2 basil leaves, 2
whole cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of whole cumin seeds and 2 pinches licorice powder. Sip hot, during and
after meals.
For pitta types: 2 pinches of Indian sarsaparilla powder, 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, 2 pinches of licorice
powder, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds and 1/2 teaspoon of coriander seeds. Drink at body temperature
throughout the day, alternating with plain boiled water.
For vata types: 1/2 teaspoon whole cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon whole coriander seeds, 1/2 teaspoon
fennel seeds, 3 pinches of ashwagandha root powder and 1 pinch whole root licorice powder. Drink
warm.

21

•

Exercise each day as your body craves routine. If you exercise at fifty percent capacity at the same time
every day, eat at the same time and sleep at the same time, your body will respond with better digestion,
better sleep and overall better immunity. Yoga, walking, cycling, dancing and swimming are all
excellent in this regard. The way to tell if you are exerting more than fifty percent capacity and starting
to exceed your capacity is if sweat starts to form on your nose, forehead or under the arms. Another
sign is if you can no longer breathe through the nose. Breathing through the nose is recommended for
ayurvedic exercise. If you start to need to gulp air through the mouth, it's time to slow down or stop. If
you follow this one guideline, you will always feel energized by exercise instead of exhausted. Each
day, you will find that your capacity increases and that you can exercise more intensely or for a longer
duration. Very naturally you will be able to handle more exercise without ever straining.

•

The practices of meditation, chanting and pranayama will also help balance the mind, subtly tone the
body, improve digestion and massively reduce stress.

•

Retiring to bed early and waking early is necessary for the maintenance of hormone balance in the mind
and body – this creates happiness and a stress-free mind; the prerequisite of proper digestion.

•

Better relationships are formed when the mind and body are in harmony. The beauty of Ayurveda is
that it takes into account all areas of life. While you may think that your problems with relationships
start with the other person, the fact remains that you can change only yourself. Most relationships go
wrong when the people involved start blaming each other. If you stop and look within, you will surely
find that blame doesn't always lie with the other person. At the basis of all relationships is the human
heart. The heart is the seat of Sadhaka Pitta, the sub-dosha of Pitta concerned with emotions. To use
modern terminology, Sadhaka Agni is related to the neuro-hormones that are located in the brain and all
over the body, including the heart. The neuro-hormones located in the heart send signals to the brain to
register depression or happiness, depending on how the individual processes an experience.
It is important to understand and thereby respect the special psycho-emotional makeup of others.
Rather than blame others for reacting differently than we do, it's better to develop understanding and
tolerance, based on the knowledge of Ayurvedic mind-body types. If you are feeling irritated with
someone, it's best to look to your own physiology rather than blame him or her. Once we start to live
more in harmony with nature we are naturally more tolerant and forgiving. Good digestion not only
positively effects our physical health but our mental and emotional health as well but. This also works
the other way round; better relationships create better digestion, better health and a happier life.

Other nutritional considerations
Water
Water is essential to life. It has many healing properties and contributes up to 70% of our body weight. It keeps
the skin soft, supple and free of wrinkles, removes inorganic mineral deposits, flushes out toxins, prevents
constipation, protects against viruses/infections and helps remove cholesterol and excess fat. The type of water
we drink today, and the insufficient amounts consumed, contribute to arteriosclerosis, illness and premature
aging. Unfortunately tap water often contains the residues or homeopathic concentrations of modern drugs and
hormones which are not removed during the filtration process at sewage plants. It may also contain toxic
chemicals such as chlorine and fluoride. Even today’s naturally distilled water, rain, is often polluted by our
industrial technology. Bottled water, water filters water purifiers, water coolers, water softeners, reverse osmosis
systems and water distillers may help rectify this situation. However, whilst distilled water contains only pure
H2O - water that is free from harmful inorganic compounds, toxic chemicals, bacteria and viruses - the electricity
and heat used to produce it may reduce it’s ‘life-energy’ or prana.
We should ideally drink between 1 - 2 litres per day depending on our body-type. Just as we use hot water to
soften and dissolve impurities and fat from our dishes, pots and pans so too should we use it to detoxify our
body. Cold water hardens and congeals fat in our body whilst hot water softens and dissolves fat. Cold water
slows down our digestive capabilities and hinders digestion whilst hot water speeds up our metabolism and helps
the digestive process. Body or room temperature water is relatively neutral and preferable to cold water
consumption. Water combined with tea or coffee acts as a diuretic and should be followed by an equal amount of
plain water to prevent dehydration. Adding a slice of lemon or ginger to our hot water can help the cleansing
process and further improve digestion.
Table Salt (sodium chloride)
Table salt is subject to very high temperatures during the refining process which hardens the grains and allows
them to flow more easily - it also renders them virtually insoluble in water and difficult for the body to
metabolise. This can cause water-logging of our tissues, increased blood pressure and encrustation of the
arteries, veins and capillaries. We should therefore reduce the use of refined table salt and favour natural salts
such as unrefined sea salt, black or rock salt instead. Kelp and other seaweeds are also excellent sources of
organic sodium as are many vegetables; celery being especially good.
Meat Products
Meat is often high in saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which may contribute to clogging of the arteries. It
can also contain dangerous microbes such as salmonella and E.coli, as well as many residual antibiotics and
steroids. Red meat in particularly is very heating to the body and very difficult to digest. It is best to obtain our
protein from grains, cereals, soya products, pulses, lentils, nuts and seeds. However, if meat forms a large part of
your diet; eat organic, favour chicken and fish and ensure an adequate supply of fresh fruit, pure water and
vegetables.
Processing and Refining Foods
These modern techniques reduce the nutritional value of foodstuffs by as much as 95%. Many have sugar or salt
added to improve taste or prolong shelf life, while others contain inorganic minerals, flavouring and synthetic
additives. The body cannot utilise these harmful substances and wastes a great deal of energy in its attempt to
expel them from our body. Consuming vast quantities of these products inevitably leads to ill health and
premature aging as the body builds up toxic substances it has failed to eliminate.
Carbohydrates, Oils and Fats
These play an essential role in our body and are responsible for our energy levels, tissue repair, hormone
production and vitamin assimilation. Fast releasing carbohydrates such as refined white sugar are best avoided

23

while slow releasing carbohydrates found in whole-grains, fruit and vegetables are vital for proper cell-to-cell
communication and tissue functioning. Oils high in linoleic acid and/or alpha-linoleic acid are essential to the
body. Hemp, Flax, Pumpkin, Walnut, Udo’s and Soya bean oil are excellent with Sunflower, Safflower,
Sesame, Rice Bran and Evening Primrose coming a close second. Again, the refining and processing of these
oils destroys their life-enhancing properties and renders them harmful to the body. It is best to try and obtain
organic, unrefined, cold-pressed oils whenever possible and to remember that only small quantities are required
by the body each day for optimum health and vitality.
Vitamins and minerals
Whilst the body requires an abundant supply of vitamins and minerals it is generally accepted that the soil our
food is grown in is no longer as effective in supplying these nutrients as it once was. Our soils are over-used and
crop rotation has become a thing of the past so nutrients are taken out but not returned.
Non-organic produce is further disadvantaged by the fact that the pesticides, fungicides and insecticides, used to
help increase production, prevent the plants from producing many of the nutrients in the quantities that we
require for good health. Fertilisers may be added to the soil but these again are mainly inorganic and do not
possess the wide spectrum of minerals required for good health – if certain minerals are not put back into the soil
the plant will no longer possess them in it’s make-up and we will therefore no longer have them in our diets.
However, supplementing our diet with vitamin and mineral supplements may have limited effect and may even
be detrimental to our health. Firstly, most supplements are inorganic and have been synthetically produced in a
laboratory – this means that they will lack the essential ‘life-energy’ that we only receive from ‘live’ plants and
our body may have limited capacity to use the lifeless nutrients contained within them. Many people have
reported that some supplements they have taken come straight out the other end with the manufacturer’s details
still visible on the tablet! Secondly, it is practically impossible to replicate nature and finding the right ‘blend’ of
nutrients to ensure that they go to the right place in the right amounts and produce right effects is nigh on
impossible too. Thirdly, we all have different body-types and therefore different vitamin/mineral requirements so
no one pill will suit all people. What may be beneficial for one person may be detrimental to the next and cause
further toxicity in the body.
The only way to really guarantee we ingest all the nutrients we need in their correct form, combination and
quantity is to eat the correct foods, ie; fresh, organic produce. If we were to eat the recommended five servings
of organic fruit, vegetables and grains per day and vary the type of produce we choose each day this would go
most of the way towards ensuring better health. If we were also to choose foods suitable for our body type this
would help still further. If we were to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables we ate each day by
supplementing our diet with freshly prepared vegetable juices, which are very easy to digest, we would be eating
as healthily as is possible is today’s world.
Leafy Greens
Dark leafy green vegetables such as collard greens, spinach, swiss chard, mustard greens, bok choy greens,
sorrel, turnip greens and many varieties of kale are considered a particularly nutritious class of vegetables. They
contain important minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin B1 and
vitamin B2. Ayurveda recommends that we have some leafy greens each day to help meet the nutritional
requirements for optimal health.
Leafy greens help replenish liquid in the body and refresh and purify the subtle channels called shrotas. They
also supply prana or life energy that provides sustenance to mind and body. They help balance pitta and kapha.
People who need to balance vata should eat them prepared with ghee or olive oil and vata balancing spices. They
are very beneficial for people suffering from skin problems as they are cooling, gently purifying and nourishing
for the skin. Due to the high mineral content of calcium and vitamin A, leafy greens are highly beneficial for
reproductive health and menopause. They contain antioxidants that help to prevent aging and disease.

24

There are different methods of cooking leafy greens. Some are tender and cook very quickly whilst others, such
as kale, may need cooking longer. It is best to keep the leaf part whole when cooking. However, if there are
tough stems, such as on collard greens and kale, then it is best to slice the stem into bite size pieces. The tough
stem should be cooked until tender or it may cause abdominal discomfort.
Genetic engineering
This technology involves inserting genetic material from animals, insects, virus’s and other organisms into the
DNA of food products such as corn, soybeans, and tomatoes. From an Ayurvedic perspective nature's innate
organizing power or intelligence is woven into the DNA and determines the characteristics of different species.
By splicing foreign genetic material into the DNA of a plant, the plant's fundamental connection with the
wholeness of life is damaged. This damage gets passed on to us at the dinner table.
The ayurvedic texts define the source of all disease and suffering as pragyaparadh, or "the mistake of the
intellect." This occurs when individuals (or even single cells) "forget" their connections with the wholeness of
life and believe themselves to be isolated entities. Creating, and then eating, genetically engineered foods
exposes us to pragyaparadh.
We are all threads in the fabric of creation, say ancient ayurvedic texts. To believe ourselves to be the weavers,
capable of successfully manipulating nature's intelligence, is a symptom of pragyaparadh and this assumption
reveals our ultimate naiveté. The genetic program of a living organism is vastly more powerful and more
complex than limited human intelligence.
Therefore, consuming genetically food exposes us to unknown forces that may seriously damage the fine tuning
and functioning of our physiology and cause long-tem chronic health problems.
The adverse effects of eating microwaved food
Microwave cooking is one of the most important causes of ill health but has largely been ignored by the
public due to its speed and convenience. Russian research concerning adverse neurological effects of altered
magnetic states of microwaved foods caused the Russian government to outlaw all food microwave apparatus in
1976 (this law was unfortunately lifted after Perestroika).
Another study reported in the US journal Paediatrics (vol. 89, no. 4, April 1992) showed depletion of antibodies
and breakdown of enzymes when breast milk is microwaved. The US Food and Drug Association also found a
problem with the release of potentially toxic molecules into the food from packaging designed to help brown
food during microwaving.
Microwaves also tend to heat foods unevenly, indicating that some of the food is not sufficiently heated to kill
all the bacteria or parasites that might be present. This uneven heating also creates hot spots in food that may
release synthetic oestrogens found in certain plastics. But even when using only glass (Pyrex) containers, low
levels of radiation escaping from the ovens may be harmful.
Two researchers, Dr. Bernard H. Blanc and Dr. Hans Hertel, confirmed that microwave cooking significantly
changes food nutrients and has a detrimental effect on the human body. Their research revealed the following
about microwaved food:
•

The body cannot recognise and consequently not metabolize radiolytic byproducts (isomers) created in
microwaved food. These by-products accumulate in the body.

•

Male and female hormone production is altered by continually eating microwaved food.

•

Minerals, vitamins and nutrients are quantitatively reduced and qualitatively altered, so that the body
gets little or no benefit, and absorbs these altered compounds that cannot be broken down.

25

•

The minerals in vegetables are altered into cancerous free-radicals.

•

Microwaved food causes stomach and intestinal tumours as well as cancerous cells in the blood.

•

The prolonged eating of microwaved food causes increase of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

•

Continually eating food processed in a microwave oven gradually causes brain damage by de-polarising
or de-magnetising brain tissue.

•

Continual ingestion of microwaved food causes immune system deficiencies through lymph gland and
blood serum alterations (increase of white and decrease of red blood cells).

•

Eating microwaved food causes loss of memory and concentration, emotional instability and a decrease of
intelligence.

Microwaved blood kills patient
In 1991, there was a lawsuit in Oklahoma concerning the hospital use of a microwave oven to warm blood
needed in a transfusion. The case involved a hip surgery patient, Norma Levitt, who died from a simple blood
transfusion. It seems the nurse had warmed the blood in a microwave oven. This tragedy makes it very apparent
that there's much more to "heating" with microwaves than we've been led to believe. Blood for transfusions is
routinely warmed, but not in microwave ovens. In the case of Mrs. Levitt, the microwaving altered the blood and
it killed her. It's very obvious that this form of microwave radiation "heating" does something to the substances it
heats. It's also becoming quite apparent that people who process food in a microwave oven are also ingesting
these "unknowns". Because the body is electrochemical in nature, any force that disrupts or changes human
electrochemical events will affect the physiology of the body.
Also, from an Ayurvedic perspective, food cooked in this unnatural way lacks prana or ‘life-energy’ and has
little usefulness as part of a healthy balanced diet. However, whichever way you look at it, there appears to be
very serious concerns regarding the safety of eating food cooked in micro-waved ovens and therefore subject to
high frequency, alternating current electromagnetic waves. Should you be the owner of such a dangerous gadget
we recommend that you give it to the nice men at the recycling centre and don't just give it to someone else!

Eat only when you are hungry (sometimes only a drink is required to satisfy a craving).
Eat breakfast to help prevent a mid-morning energy slump (especially Vata types).
Drink a glass of fresh, organic fruit/vegetable juice each day (esp; carrot, apple and spinach).
Don’t mix fruit and vegetables juices apart from carrot and apple.
Eat the largest meal at mid-day – this is when the digestive fire is at its strongest.
Take ‘Ginger Pickle’ (see recipe section) half an hour before each meal.
Sit down whilst eating and put your full attention on the food being eaten - do not divide the mind and
weaken the digestive juices by excessive talking, reading or watching television. Always be conscious
of the taste of food and the act of eating and try and eat in a settled, peaceful environment.
Eat only food that is attractive, wholesome, aromatic and tasty - this ensures proper digestion.
Eat fresh, organic food whenever possible and always avoid processed and refined products.
Try to avoid lifeless, nutrient-poor food such as micro-waved, pre-cooked, left-over or canned.
Favour unprocessed, unrefined oils such as Udo’s, flax, pumpkin, ghee and olive oil.
Use honey, maple syrup, fructose, algarve and stevia extract for sweetening.
Reduce the use of refined sugar, salt, white flour, hard cheese and processed or micro-waved food.
Ttry and avoid tea, coffee, alcohol, pastries and meat. If you do eat meat try and choose white meat or
fish in preference to red meat as they are easier to digest.
Use soya, rice, almond, hazelnut or oat milk as a substitute for pasteurised cow’s milk.
Sip hot water during a meal but refrain from taking any liquids for up to half an hour before and after
food. This ensures that the stomach’s digestive enzymes do not become diluted.
Drink one to two litres of mineral/distilled water or herbal teas daily. Ginger, lemon, peppermint,
fennel, coriander and the digestive teas (see recipe section) are good.
Drink hot water with fresh lemon or fresh ginger to reduce weight and/or eliminate toxins/impurities.
Eat fruit separately from main meals to prevent fermentation in the gut.
If you are a Pitta type, or even a Kapha type with good digestion, you can include a small salad and
dressing before your main mid-day meal in the summertime.
Always chew your food thoroughly – this stimulates the salivary glands and also ensures food reaches
the stomach in a pre-digested, liquid form that is easier to digest and assimilate.
Avoid over-eating – rest and relax for a few minutes before taking a second helping.
The amount of chewed food that will fit into your cupped hands is equal to the size of a third of your
stomach. Your digestion system works at its best when your stomach contains one third food, one third
liquid and one third space at the end of a main meal.
Leave the table feeling sated but not heavy and bloated – energy levels should feel replenished.
Take a short stroll after a large meal, and then a short rest afterwards if desired
If you are a Vata type and experience flagging energy during late afternoon, stop and have a small
snack or fruit juice.
Eat at least three hours before bed and only have a light meal of cereal, toast or soup.
Vata types benefit from milky bedtime drink with added ghee, cinnamon, nutmeg and raisins.
Aloe vera juice is good for everyone but it is especially beneficial for those suffering from pitta
imbalances. It is good for digestion, cleansing and elimination. Take about 30mls of the juice each day.
Turmeric is both bitter and astringent and is a blood purifier and antioxidant. One teaspoon cooked with
your meals is an excellent way to increase antioxidant intake. Vata people should use half this amount
as it is can sometimes be too drying and depleting for them.

The day starts the night before.

An early night ensures deep, refreshing sleep.
Deep, refreshing sleep ensures one wakes early - rested and revitalised.
Waking early - rested and revitalised - ensures time for massage, yoga and meditation.
Massage, yoga and meditation ensure the mind and body are awake and alive.
Mind and body - fully awake and alive - ensure a happy countenance.
A happy countenance ensures a stress-free mind.
A stress-free mind creates a positive mind.
A stress-free, positive mind imparts love and peace to those around.
An atmosphere of love and peace creates a wave of harmony throughout the room.
A wave of harmony throughout the room creates a wave of harmony throughout the house.
A wave of harmony throughout the house creates a wave of harmony throughout the city.
A wave of harmony throughout the city creates a wave of harmony throughout the country.
A wave of harmony throughout the country creates a wave of harmony throughout the world.
The peace and harmony of every individual in every town, in every city, in every country is in your power and
their happiness rests in your arms. If you are fully awake in the present moment, having learnt from and let go
of the past, the future will take care of itself. You simply need to bathe in the joy of being fully alive in every
present waking moment.
And the real beauty is – you can start today.

Daily routines, exercise & yoga
~ how to stay fit & supple & delay the process of aging ~

Whenever the wavering and unsteady heart wanders away,
then so often let him subdue it and bring it back to the control of the soul;
For supreme happiness comes to the yogi whose heart is at rest,
in whom passion is tranquilised, who is one with Brahma, and free from sin.
The Yogi thus uniting his soul, who has ceased from sin,
enjoys easily the boundless happiness of union with Brahma.

Dinacharya
- living in harmony with nature’s rhythms Dinacharya, the Sanskrit word for daily routine, is a simple and effective way to balance the body. Our daily
activities have a profound effect on our health and a routine, practiced daily, is stronger medicine than an
occasional remedy. Dinacharya establishes healthful habits through attunement of the body to the natural cycles
of the day. The three doshas, vata, pitta and kapha, each have their own periods of time within a twenty-four
hour day in which their energies predominate. By establishing a routine that “goes with the flow ” of these
elemental energies, we are able to more easily support the body ’s natural rhythms and healing potential.
Waking
The first Vata period of the day ends around dawn with the first rays of sunlight. At this time of day Vata
qualities are at their strongest and if we arise between 4–6am we will imbibe the positive qualities of alertness,
vibrancy, enthusiasm, energy, clarity, strengthened intuition and motivation. It is the most sattvic, peaceful, and
still time of day and is an ideal time for spiritual practice. If there are time constraints we can simply take a few
deep breaths and adopt an attitude of gratitude for waking up to an exciting new day.
Elimination
Our bladder and colon should be emptied upon rising. To facilitate this practice we can drink a glass or two of
warm water with a slice of lemon added. This helps rehydrate the tissues, flush toxins that have accumulated
overnight, enkindles agni or digestive fire and stimulates peristalsis.
Cleansing the senses
Ayurveda recommends purifying the senses each day in preparation for taking in all the rich, new experiences
that life has to offer. Refresh and energise the mind by splashing the face and eyes with cool or luke-warm water.
Gently wash the ears and apply a thin coat of sesame oil to the inside of the ear with your little finger. Use a neti
pot with saline solution to cleanse the nasal passages. Brush the teeth. Scrape the tongue using a tongue cleaner
to remove any coating. Notice your tongue each morning. A thick coating is indicative of ama, or toxins in the
digestive tract. Scraping the tongue helps to purify your sense of taste and benefits the internal organs. Finally,
gargle with warm water, or salt water and turmeric to help purify and strengthen the voice and keep the gums,
mouth and throat healthy.
Abhyanga
According to Ayurveda, abhyanga, or oil massage is an essential component of dinacharya. This practice
nourishes and strengthens the body, encourages regular sleep patterns, stimulates internal organs, enhances blood
circulation and can significantly reduce vata.
Bathe
After you have massaged your entire body, enjoy a warm bath or shower using a minimal amount of mild soap.
Towel dry with a towel you do not mind collecting oil with.
Clothing
Always wear clean clothing, preferably made from natural fibres such as cotton, wool, linen or silk. Ayurveda
discourages wearing used clothing, particularly other peoples’ shoes, because of the polluted subtle energies
which they collect.
Take your herbs
Taking herbs at the same time each day will enhance their medicinal effect. Herbs taken on an empty stomach
have the most potent action in the body.

30

Mild exercise
Daily exercise increases circulation and oxygenation of the tissues, strengthens agni, tones the body, reduces fat
and enhances vitality. Determine the best time to exercise and what form of exercise to practice with
consideration to your prakriti (constitutional type) and the effects of the seasons. For example, in the fall, a vata
person should exercise during the kapha time of day, to take advantage of kapha’s grounding and stable qualities.
Choose an activity that is soothing to the nervous system like yoga or tai chi.
Meditation
Just as we cleanse our bodies each day, we must also cleanse our minds of accumulated thoughts that no longer
serve us. Be still. Direct your attention inward. Notice your breath. Practice pranayama. Meditate for twenty
minutes or simply invite calm and relaxation into the body if time is limited. This practice acts as a protective
shield to the destabilizing influences of the external environment.
Aerobic exercise
The next morning period is Kapha which has the qualities of heaviness, slowness and stability – the later a
person awakes after dawn the more of these qualities he imbibes within his physiology and carries with him for
the rest of the day. Kapha time (especially between 7am and 10am) is the best time for more physical exercise,
such as jogging, swimming or cycling.
Work and lunch
10am to 2pm, when pitta predominates, is the most productive time for work, especially for problem solving or
completing tasks that requires your full attention and focus. It is also the time when the sun is at its peak and
when the digestive fire or agni is at its strongest. It is therefore the ideal time to eat the largest meal of the day.
Eating at this time will allow efficient and maximum digestion, assimilation and metabolism. Proper absorption
of minerals, vitamins, proteins and carbohydrates will result in efficient energy production and feelings of
strength and alertness. It follows that there will also be less desire for snacking and overeating if the diet
contains adequate nutrition and the ability to properly assimilate it. A short, leisurely stroll shortly after lunch
will also aid digestion.
Creative work
Vata comes around again during the afternoon. This is a good time for mental agility and creative work. Vata
types may experience a drop in energy at this time and a small snack is valuable for them.
Evening meal
Only light meals should be eaten in the evenings (toast, rice, semolina, milk drinks, noodles, soup etc). It is
important to have allowed enough time for your previous meal to have been digested thoroughly (generally 4
hours) but should ideally be taken before sundown and at least three hours before bedtime.
Relaxation
The next Kapha period begins in the early evening. The heavy, slow, stable qualities of this dosha increase as
the evening progresses and reach their peak a couple of hours before midnight. In order to imbibe these qualities
and ensure a sound, heavy, undisturbed and restful sleep one should be in bed before this period ends. Evening
is a kapha energy period and is a time to relax, engage in pleasant conversation with family or friends, read light
novels or play gentle, soothing music. It is a time to unwind from the stimulation and activity of the day. About
half an hour before bedtime is the perfect time to take Triphala tea to gentle tone and balance to the digestive
tract.
Bathing
Ayurveda sees bathing as a therapeutic activity and the evening is a good time to partake in this therapy. A
leisurely bath relaxes tense muscles, irons out a creased brow, opens clogged pores, restores moisture to the
tissues, and adds a healing dimension to your day. It enhances physical energy levels and improves mental

31

clarity. It helps remove sweat, dirt and environmental toxins from the skin. It helps relax the mind and balance
the emotions.
Ideally begin with a full-body warm oil massage. Then bathe, using water that is neither too hot nor too cold.
Apply a cleanser to your skin gently. Do not bathe in a hurry. Take your time and try to relax so that both mind
and body benefit from the bath. Use gentle aromatherapy oils such as lavender, sandalwood, patchouli or orange
(do not use harsh or artificial fragrances that strip moisture from the skin and damage the delicate wisdom that
facilitates the reflection of the inner glow, called prabha in ayurveda). The ancient ayurvedic texts also
recommend adding rose petals, milk, honey, and turmeric to your bath. After you towel off, spritz your body
with rose water.
Sleep
Finally, the next active Pitta period runs from 10pm until about 2am. If one is not asleep during this period the
body begins to wake up and one attains a second wind around 11pm, which may have you up until 1am! Sleep is
then impaired and the elimination of impurities and toxins within the body suffers greatly. Being in bed by 10pm
will ensure 6-7 hours of refreshing, detoxifying sleep that will leave you revitalised and re-energised. It is a good
practice to apply oil to the scalp and the soles of the feet before bed to calm the nervous system and promote
sound sleep.
This Pitta period is also a second ‘digestive phase’ but it is not intended for digesting large quantities of food or
heavy foodstuffs. The metabolism work differently than at midday and is far less efficient in terms of breaking
down the contents of the stomach and intestines. It will try to digest them as well as possible but usually leaves
the process incomplete leading to a further build up of undigested food or ‘Ama’ (hence the very furry, white
tongue in the morning after a late night of alcohol and heavy food). This is why the evening meal should be light
and easily digestible.
Following dinacharya is a way to bring more awareness to all of the habits and choices we make throughout the
day. Conscious awareness in our daily lives enables us to be whole and healthy beings, bringing us closer to our
true selves. Living in harmony with the cycles of nature is not only the path to health, but to true freedom.

Seasonal Rhythms
As the day goes through a cycle of Vata, Pitta and Kapha so does the year.
The qualities of Vata are cold and moving (wind) and these qualities are prevalent in the winter. Vata-types
especially must try to follow a Vata pacifying routine and diet at this time of year to prevent Vata dosha from
drifting out of balance. When the cool, dry winds begin to blow it can sometimes be difficult to maintain a
peaceful, grounded state of being. Having a routine to follow restores balance throughout the day, everyday,
safeguarding against the anxiety and stress associated with increased vata.
Summer is hot, just like Pitta dosha, and those prone to Pitta-type imbalances should keep cool and follow a Pitta
pacifying routine and diet.
Spring (and to some extent autumn) can be cold and damp exhibiting the qualities of Kapha. Kapha-types
should follow a Kapha pacifying diet and routine to keep their bodies in balance and free from the usual
complaints of flu, cold and blocked sinuses.

Abhyanga oil massage
Abhyanga is the anointing of the body with warm, medicated oil. For thousands of years, people have used
abhyanga to improve sleep, calm the nervous system and increase longevity. Abhyanga helps the skin release
toxins and also facilitates the trans-dermal absorption of nutrients and healing properties from the herbs and oils
used in massage. It is used as a medicine for certain disorders.
There are seven layers of tissue in the body (called dhatus) and each successive layer is more concentrated and
life-giving. For oil to reach the deepest layers it must be massaged into the body for about fifteen-minutes. The
benefits of Abhyanga as outlined in the Vedic texts (Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita and Ashtanga
Hrdayam) are as follows:

Recharges and rejuvenates mind and body.
Delays the aging process and promotes longevity.
Produces greater vitality, energy, stamina and physical endurance.
Lubricates the joints and promotes flexibility.
Increase muscle strength and firmness.
Nourishes, tones and purifies the skin.
Enhances complexion and lustre of skin (more radiant/ attractive, softer/smoother).
Stimulates the circulation and prevents impurities from accumulating in the body resulting in greater
resistance to illness and faster recovery from trauma, injury or disease.
Pacifies the doshas (especially vata & pitta).
Dissolves accumulated stress or toxins from the mind and body (stress causes skin to age prematurely).
Increases mental alertness.
Calms the nerves and balances mind and emotions.
Improves elimination of impurities from the body.
Allows more refreshing, deeper sleep.
Reduces bacterial infections.
Nourishes the seven different types of body tissue and the seven layers of the skin.
Applying oil to the scalp makes the hair grow luxuriantly, thick, soft and glossy; it also soothes and
invigorates the sense organs and removes facial wrinkles.
Applying oil to the ears rectifies disorders of the ear which are due to increased vata; it also improves
stiffness in the neck and jaw.
Applying oil to the feet alleviates stiffness, roughness and fatigue whilst also strengthening and firming
them. It also enhances vision, pacifies vata, reduces sciatica symptoms and tones local veins and
ligaments.

Self-massage is ideally undertaken each morning but early evenings are also very effective. Try to avoid
massaging immediately after a large meal so as not to interfere with digestion.
Sesame oil is the best oil to use on the body while coconut oil (good for delaying greying and receding of hair) is
best used on the head and face. The ripening process detailed below enhances the healing/medicinal properties of
sesame oil:
How to cure your oil for maximum therapeutic results:
Place the required quantity of oil into a heavy bottomed saucepan and heat on medium setting until the oil has
reached 100 degrees centigrade (use a liquid thermometer to gauge this). Alternatively, if you don’t have a
thermometer, simply add one or two drops of water to the oil before heating. Always use a medium heat and
never leave the room while oil is heating, as it is highly inflammable.

35

As the oil heats a crackling sound is heard - this is the water boiling off. When the crackling stops the oil has
reached the correct temperature. Allow the oil to cool. It is now ripened and can be stored in a suitable
container for up to one month. Re-ripen if stored for longer.
How to carry out your own Ayurvedic oil massage:
Carry out your daily oil massage in a warm, comfortable room and heat the oil to body temperature before
applying to the body (either place a small amount of oil in a small stainless steel bowl and warm over a candle
burner or place the glass/plastic oil container in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes before use).
Start by using coconut oil on the face and scalp, paying particular attention to the ears. Slow, gentle strokes are
preferable. Sesame oil is used for the rest of the body. Start with the arms, paying particular attention to the
hands and fingers. Next massage the front of the body with slow, gentle strokes over the abdomen. The back is
somewhat more awkward but do what you can reach – use the backs of your hands to cover more area. Massage
the buttocks and legs finishing with the feet (give a little extra time and attention here).
As a rule, circular massage strokes are used over joints and long sweeping movements along the arm/leg bones.
Five or ten circles/long strokes per area should be given depending on the time available. For even greater
therapeutic effects a few drops of essential oil may be added to your massage oil. We recommend no more than
10 drops of lavender, cederwood, sandalwood, patchouli, ylang ylang or frankincense per 100ml of massage oil.
It is beneficial to keep the oil on the skin for at least twenty minutes before showering. Water should be warm
rather than hot and soap should be used sparingly to allow a residue of oil to remain on the skin.
Sesame oil’s highly medicinal, therapeutic effects are probably due to its high linoleic content which has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties. However, if you find sesame oil too
heating coconut oil, olive oil or sunflower can applied instead.
“The body of one who uses oil massage regularly does not become affected much even if subjected to accidental
injuries, or strenuous work. By using oil massage daily, a person is endowed with pleasant touch, trimmed body
parts and becomes strong, charming and least affected by old age.”
Charaka Samhita Vol. 1, V: 88-89

Daily massage plan
The ideal early morning (5-6am) routine includes:
•
Drinking hot water
•
Emptying bowels/bladder
•
Cleaning teeth/scraping tongue
•
Skin brushing (upward strokes)
•
Massaging the body with sesame oil and the head with coconut oil (can be after shower/bath)
•
Taking a shower/bath (with warm water and a vegetable-based soap)
However, if time is limited or you’d like some variation on this routine a massage plan that runs over the course
of one week is suggested below. This can be adapted to your needs and varied each week. Massaging after your
bath or shower is also acceptable if it is more convenient or preferable. If you massage after your shower make
sure you use a special towel to take off excess oil. This towel will need to be boil-washed to remove all the oil.

You may also gargle and massage inside of nostrils with sesame oil as this helps combat colds/flu and other
viral/bacterial infections. Please note: Tongue scraping should be done with a steel, silver or gold tonguescraper – four or five runs gently over the tongue should be enough to remove any ama (undigested
food/bacteria). This procedure helps improve digestion, freshens the breath and removes impurities from the
body.

So-hum meditation
The mind naturally and effortlessly transcends everyday worries and concerns when it is given the opportunity
but with the hectic lives we lead today this rarely happens. Perhaps in odd moments, while we’re taking a break
in a quiet park or have witnessed a beautiful sunset, a momentary peace and calmness suddenly descends,
leaving us feeling refreshed and alert; bathed in a bubble of stillness and silence. This fleeting occurrence takes
us by surprise but reminds us of the joy of life and the possibilities it could hold if only we could learn to enjoy
it.
What does not seem to be widely known is that this state is easily and effortlessly achieved through a few
minutes’ practice of an amazingly simple but effective technique known as meditation. It can be taught in a few
minutes, can be practiced by anyone and will work anywhere.
With the help of a subtle sound or mantra the mind can effortlessly transcend to this silent state of heightened
awareness and rest within minutes. What’s more, the practice of this very simple technique helps build a solid
foundation for the mind, allowing it to effortlessly remain calm in the most stressful and demanding situations.
Meditation allows the mind to see more clearly and work more efficiently and effectively for prolonged periods
of time without becoming unduly tired or strained. Thus we can truly “do less and accomplish more”.
It’s our birthright to enjoy a healthy, stress-free life and this can be achieved by allowing the mind to rest and
recharge at regular intervals with a few minutes meditation; a technique which produces levels of rest and
relaxation many times more effective than sleep.
Progressively, over the centuries, this natural mind-relaxing procedure has been complicated, mystified and
watered down. By many it is seen as a battle to conquer the mind and senses and thus best left to the spiritual
aspirant who has the time and will to perfect his/her technique. Meditation should be neither a process of deep
concentration nor one of intense contemplation – it is simply an effortless way of allowing the mind to transcend
to deep levels of relaxation very quickly, easily and effortlessly.
Meditation is simply a matter of being taught how to use specific internal sounds correctly so that they act as
vehicles for the mind to experience progressively more subtle values of those sounds. Eventually, one
effortlessly reaches the silent field of all possibilities where thoughts, words or sounds originate.
The practice described here involves simply sitting quietly in a calm and peaceful environment and observing the
gentle inflow and outflow of ones breath. This quickly relaxes the mind and harmonises the nervous system.
However, this is only achieved if one’s thoughts are allowed to flow unhindered with no judgment or forcing
away of thoughts. Thoughts cannot be stopped and all attempts at trying to do so will produce strain – just pay
no attention to them and let them go.

38

Vedic Meditation instructions
•

Allow yourself 15-20 minutes of undisturbed silence in a calm, peaceful environment.

•

Start by sitting comfortably and relaxing with the eyes closed for a few minutes.

•

Have the intention to meditate – this means putting aside any ideas of using the time allocated to simply
rest, sleep or mull things over.

•

Now slowly, innocently and effortlessly become aware of your breath.

•

Notice the gentle sound of ‘so’ on each in breath and the sound of ‘hum’ on each out breath.

•

Do not deliberately mentally repeat the sound – just allow it to be there in your awareness – it should
almost seem to repeat itself - just observe it and allow it to become naturally independent of the breath allow it to become fainter and fainter, quieter and quieter, more and more distant until it almost fades
away. Allow it to eventually fade away.

•

As it fades away the mind settles down, relaxes and occasionally transcends – often stresses are released
as this happens. Stresses are released on the back of thoughts – thus, as you release stress you will have
thoughts. The more powerful the stress being released the more powerful and absorbing the thoughts will
be that surface in your awareness.

•

As soon as you become aware of thoughts other than the mantra (‘so-hum’) gently ‘favour’ the mantra
again – i.e, gently, innocently and effortlessly go back to witnessing the mantra. The bigger the stress
being released the more your mind will present you with thoughts – just innocently and effortlessly let
them go rather than staying with them and turn your awareness back towards the mantra (so – hum)
instead.

•

It is important to realise that it is rare to meditate without lots of thoughts also being present. This is a
sign of correct meditation. Meditation releases stress – hence thoughts will frequently arise.

•

Meditation is only experienced as ‘difficult’ or ‘boring’ when we start straining to ‘hold’ the mantra in our
awareness and ‘try’ to ‘focus’ or ‘concentrate’ on keeping the mantra present in our mind and ‘keeping’ or
‘forcing’ other thoughts out. Thoughts are part of meditation – thoughts are good – thoughts are stresses
disappearing forever.

•

Meditation is not about concentrating, focusing, contemplating or forcing the mind. Meditation is about
gently, innocently and effortlessly ‘favouring’ a sound (mantra) – it is about quietly witnessing and
allowing thoughts to flow unhindered and then effortlessly coming back to the sound (mantra) when other
thoughts have taken its place.

•

After 15-20 minutes stop ‘favouring’ the mantra and sit quietly with the eyes still closed for 2-3 minutes.
This allows the mind and body to fully integrate and process the experience to gain maximum benefits.

•

If there have been many thoughts during the meditation, rest for longer (up to ten minutes) as it is a sign
that you have released lots of stresses and need longer to integrate the experience.

•

Practice for 15-20 minutes twice a day. Dawn and dusk are the best times as the mind and body are more
alert and relaxed. Avoid practicing immediately after a large meal or before bedtime (it wakes you up!).

•

Try and practice at the same times each day so that the mind already comes prepared. Have the intention
to meditate and then allow a few minutes for the mantra to appear of its own accord – if it doesn’t
spontaneously appear then quietly and innocently introduce it as a ‘vague’, distant idea. It may or may not
follow the breath and it is unimportant whether it does or not – some people find it easier if it does and
some don’t. Don’t worry about how often the sound disappears and other thoughts arise; just simply bring
the mantra back again as quietly as possible.

39

Pranayama
Through the practice of pranayama (a controlled breathing exercise) we bring conscious awareness to the breath,
uniting mind and body in a present moment experience. Through this awareness, and with a little practice, we
learn how to access our inner wisdom and increase our Prana, the omnipresent life force, that determines the
amount of energy, clarity and joy we have in our lives.
Pranayama is best practiced in the early morning when the mind is clear and free from the experiences of the
day. Also, practiced after yoga asana, it can be the perfect transition into meditation. This is also a useful and
simple tool to bring us into balance before an exam, meeting or presentation. Just a few minutes can bring us
back to our centre, easing anxiety and nervous tension.
Alternate Nostril Breathing (Vata Pranayama): Nadi Shodhana, or alternate nostril breathing, is a type of
pranayama that balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain and has a calming effect on the nervous
system while creating a more alert mind. It cleanses the channels of the subtle energy body by removing
energetic blockages along the nadis (channels) that correspond to the nerve ganglia on either side of the spinal
cord. It is extremely centering, making it one of the best practices for vata dosha.
Begin by sitting comfortably on a cushion, folded blanket or in a chair, keeping the head and spine upright.
Bring awareness to your breathing process, noticing the quality and length of each inhalation and exhalation.
Breathe deep into your abdomen and keep the body relaxed.
Position the right hand (you may choose to alternate with each practice) in vishnu mudra by folding the index
finger and third finger inwards to lightly touch at the base of the thumb. Your little finger rests by the side of the
ring finger. You will alternately use your thumb to close your right nostril and your ring and little fingers,
working as one, to close your left. Rest your left hand comfortably in your lap. The breath should never feel
forced.
Instructions: Breathe in gently keeping the breath relaxed, subtle and light. Block the right nostril with
the thumb of the right hand and breathe out through the left nostril. Breathe in gently through the left nostril and
then block the left nostril with the fourth finger and breathe out through the right nostril. Breathe in through the
right nostril, block the right nostril and breathe out through the left nostril. Continue for five minutes and finish
by breathing in through the right nostril. If you are left-handed you will reverse these finger positions (thumb
blocks left nostril and fourth finger blocks right nostril). Always breathe in and out gently; do not force the
breath and do not hold the breath. Breathe naturally and try to sit upright and in a relaxed and comfortable
position. Envision the breath as a light thread of silk, lengthening effortlessly with each inhalation and
exhalation. Practice for five to ten minutes.
Rest after your practice and notice how you are feeling. Once comfortable with this practice, you can begin
mentally counting to four on your inhalation, pause at the space between the breath and then count to four as you
exhale, so that the length of your inhalation and exhalation are equal.
There are many variations of alternate nostril breathing. These advanced practices involve increased ratios of
inhalation to exhalation, longer duration, and the incorporation of breath retention. It is best to practice these
under the guidance of a yoga teacher or therapist. They are intended as developmental stages to work through
incrementally as the body gradually adjusts to the increased flow of prana. As with any subtle energy practice
which activates prana, it is best to start slowly and steadily incorporate it into your daily practice. A shorter
practice on a consistent basis will bring more benefit to the body than a longer practice every now and again.

Here are some variations that will help with specific dosha imbalances within the physiology:
Left Nostril Breathing (Pitta Pranayama): This breathing exercise helps cool the mind and body and is excellent
for Pitta imbalances. If the left nostril is blocked the body often feels overheated (a Pitta imbalance).
Instructions: Block your right nostril with your thumb (fourth finger if left-handed) and inhale gently
through the left nostril. Block your left nostril with your fourth finger (thumb if left-handed) and breathe out
through your right nostril. Repeat for five to ten minutes, finishing by breathing out through your right nostril
Right Nostril Breathing (Kapha Pranayama): Helps warm the body and is excellent for Kapha imbalances. If
the right nostril is blocked the body often feels cold.
Instructions: Block your left nostril with your fourth finger (thumb if left-handed) and inhale gently
through the right nostril. Block your right nostril with your thumb (fourth finger if left-handed) and breathe out
through your left nostril. Repeat for five minutes, finishing by breathing out through your left nostril
Fast Pranayama: This practice speed up metabolism and helps with weight loss. It can also be practiced for 2030 seconds before ‘alternate nostril breathing’.
Instructions: Repeatedly exhale quickly and forcefully through both nostrils. You will find that you
naturally inhale after each out breath. Repeat this for about one minute and then rest for one minute. Repeat up
to five times. You may find that the body heats up and begins to perspire slightly indicating that energy is
flowing and circulation is improving.
Hissing Breath: This is good for cleansing and detoxifying the lungs and improving lung capacity.
Instructions: Take two deep abdominal breathes. On the next out-breath, breathe out through your teeth
to make a ‘hissing’ sound. As you do so lean forward so that your head comes towards your knees. At the end
out your out-breath immediately breathe in through your nose quite rapidly as your come up to an upright
position again. Once your lungs are three-quarters full and you are in an upright position hold your breath for as
long as is comfortable. Now repeat the process six more times.
Kapalabhati: This is also good for cleansing and detoxifying the lungs and improving lung capacity.
Instructions: Take two deep abdominal breathes. Now breathe in to three-quarters capacity. On the next outbreath, breathe out forcefully twenty times by repeatedly contracting the abdominal muscles. Now take two deep
abdominal breathes and on the third, breathe in to three-quarters capacity and retain the breath for thirty seconds.
Repeat this three more times. As you become more accomplished you can increase the number of ‘abdominal
pumpings’ - up to forty and maybe even sixty. You will also find that you will naturally be able to hold the
breath for longer – perhaps even up to two minutes duration.
Belly Breath: This is good for toning the abdomen, improving peristalsis and helping with weight loss.
Instructions: In a standing position bend your knees and rest your hands on the top of the knees breathe out fully (hold the breath) and then contract abdomen up into diaphragm/rib cage – hold for as long as is
comfortable. Exhale. Repeat this exercise several times. Alternatively you can repeatedly contract the abdomen
into diaphragm during the holding of the out-breath.

Exercise
Exercise is an important part of the ayurvedic routine as it helps rid the body of heaviness and stiffness through
the burning of ama or toxins. It creates greater flexibility, lightness, energy and stamina. It also pacifies all three
doshas, creates balance, enhances digestion, improves immunity, dissolves impurities in the tissues, banishes
fatigue, stops early aging and retards weight gain.
However, too much exercise can be damaging, causing fatigue, lack of glow in the skin and face, pitta and vata
aggravation and strain on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. It can also create excess free radicals which
damage the body and have been linked to over eighty percent of degenerative disease as well as premature aging.
Ayurveda therefore recommends that no more than fifty percent of total capacity is utilised, with individual
capacity depending on daily fluctuations of energy, change of the seasons, age, and body type.
Vata types needs the least exercise, so lighter activities such as walking are best. Pitta types need moderate
amounts with swimming and skiing being good, whilst Kapha types need more intense exercise - jogging and
aerobics are good to help them stay in balance. Do more exercise in winter and spring and do less in hot weather
as this will create fatigue, especially in pitta body types.
Always start out slowly and only gradually increase the intensity and duration of exercise. Stop when you note
signs of overexertion. You know when you're doing the right amount of exercise if you feel energized and calm
afterwards. If you feel strained and exhausted, you're doing too much. You can continue to exercise until you
notice one of the following two signs of overexertion:
1.

2.

Difficulty in breathing through the nose. If you have to open your mouth to gulp in air, that's a sign that
your heart is overexerted, the circulation system is taxed and the coordination of heart and lungs is
disturbed. You should stop immediately.
Sweating on the forehead or the tip of nose. Sweating elsewhere in the body is fine but when you notice
sweat in these two places it's a sign that you are overexerted and should stop.

Yoga asanas are the ideal form of exercise for all body types and ages, because they balance the three doshas,
tone the muscles, and rejuvenate all the organs in the body. Practicing pranayama is also a good way to increase
endurance. An abhyanga oil massage before exercise will tone the muscles, get the blood circulating and prevent
injury or strain
Exercise every day as part of your regular daily routine. If possible exercise in the morning before 10am as your
body has more strength, stamina, and coordination during the kapha time of day. Exercising at this time also
energizes you and prepares you for the day ahead. Exercising in the late evening or towards bedtime is not
recommended as it can elevate body temperatures and disrupt sleep rhythms. A light walk or yoga in the evening
is fine. Also avoid exercise from 10am to 2pm, the pitta time of day, when the digestive fire is strong – this
should be reserved for eating the main meal of the day.
It's not a good idea to exercise on a full stomach - wait about two hours after eating a large meal. However, if
your stomach is empty and you are very hungry, have a light snack of fruit juice, cooked apples or some kind of
light soup before exercising.
It is important to breath through the nose at all time during exercise as this uses the whole of the lungs and not
just the upper portions. If you are breathing through the mouth you are over-exerting.

42

If you were at the zoo and a tiger escaped from its pen you would most likely take a quick upper-chest “gasping”
emergency breath. This breath would trigger a fight-or-flight response in your nervous system as the upper lobes
of the lungs are primarily innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The kind of “gasping” mouth
breathing, much like a hyperventilation breathing pattern, is a normal breathing response to extreme stress.
Unfortunately this how most people breathe during exercise and this triggers the same neurological response.
In contrast, the nerves that would calm, rejuvenate and regenerate the body are in the lower lobes of the lungs
along with the majority of the blood supply. The problem is that most people never breathe into these lower
parasympathetic dominant lobes. They therefore create a minor but constant emergency situation which creates
stress hormones and releases excess toxins into the body.
Thus, we can see that exercise can act as a double-edged sword, where it can either incur stress or remove stress,
depending on the quality of the breath. The best way to consistently breathe into the lower lobes of the lungs is
by nasal breathing. The nose is intricately designed to filter, moisten and rarefy the air we take in and drive it
into the small and distal alveoli of the lungs. It is when these distal lobes are fully perfused with air that the body
produces a neurological state of composure even while under extreme stress
If you are unfit or aren’t used to exercise first go for a short walk before attempting anything more physical. For
the first ten minutes breath in and out deeply through your nose as you walk fairly slowly. This ensures you are
exercising your lungs. Be vigilant and make sure that each breath is deeper, longer and slower than the one
before – however, the emphasis should always be on comfort rather than style. It is this experience of comfort
that you will eventually take you to higher levels of exertion. If you feel relaxed and comfortable, begin to walk
faster but be sure to maintain the same rhythm of the breath you established at the beginning.
At some point you will notice it becoming more difficult to get the air in through the nose and an ensuing urge to
take a mouth breath. When your exercise forces you to take your first mouth breathe, you have just forced the
body into an emergency breathing response to maintain that faster pace. Immediately slow down and recapture
the original deep, long and slow rhythm of the breath. Once it is re-established, try to walk faster again, telling
your body you want more performance. When the breathing gets laboured and you open your mouth again, slow
down once more. Constantly tell your body that you want more performance but that you don’t want to create an
emergency response. Soon your body will accommodate a higher level of a natural and more permanent fitness.
Because of the years of lower rib cage constriction you will more than likely find this difficult at first. But, what
you couldn't do the first day, you will find yourself effortlessly doing within two or three weeks, whilst
comfortably breathing through your nose. When this happens your rib cage is effectively and efficiently
massaging your heart and lungs up to 28,000 times a day. When this starts happening, a natural calming
influence stays with you all day while you deal with all kinds of extreme stressors. Exercise has now become one
of the your most important health-enhancing tools.

Tips for enjoying exercise
Comfort: If your breath becomes laboured, your heart beats uncomfortably fast or you begin to ache or to get a
stitch you are not within a zone of comfort and should slow down or stop and rest.
Undivided Attention: Experience the body and respond to its signals. Do not watch TV or listen to music but
allow the mind to be completely attuned and connected to the body.
Body Type: Vata types should participate in calming activities such as walking, gymnastics, aerobics, dance,
cycling, yoga or Tai Chi. Pitta types can cope with more vigorous exercise such as jogging, tennis, swimming,
skiing, weight lifting and rowing but should be careful not to become too competitive or overheated. Kapha
types need fast, vigorous exercise to counteract their more lethargic physiologies and are better suited to sports
such as football, running, weight lifting, rugby and hockey.
Warm up: Ensure you begin any training by first loosening the joints and muscles with a few gentle exercises,
sun-salute (Suryanamaskara) and yoga.
Massage: Applying oils before and after a workout is most beneficial. Vata-types should apply sesame or
almond oil with lavender before a workout and sesame or almond oil with marjoram after a workout; Pitta-types
should apply sesame or coconut oil with lemon before a workout and coconut oil with camomile afterwards
while Kapha-types should apply olive or sesame oil with eucalyptus before and sesame or olive oil with
rosemary after. A mix of 20:1 base oil to essential oil works well.
Breathing: Always breathe through the nose as this uses the lower portion of the lungs where maximum energy
is exchanged. This allows proper mind-body coordination by calming the body, slowing the heart rate and
reducing the flow of adrenalin.
Stress Check: If on waking your resting heart rate is ten beats above or below normal you should rest or at least
only take very moderate exercise that day. This often indicates that the body is under stress, possibly from a
virus or bacteria, and the body will need its energy resources that day to combat this stress.
Optimum Exercise Heart Rate (OEHR): 220 minus your age plus resting heart rate divided by two. Resting
heart rate should be ascertained on waking in the morning.
Three Phase Workout:
Resting Phase (10 min.): Do not allow heart rate to increase above OEHR minus 30.
Listening Phase (15 min): Increase pace but do not allow heart rate to increase above OEHR. Ensure heart rate,
breath rate, mental awareness and physical form are comfortable, balanced and correct.
Performance phase (10-30 min): Allow your pace to sit around the OEHR and experience comfort, balance, rest
and euphoria. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, stressed or tired go back to the Resting or Listening Phase
and build up again more slowly.

Ayurvedic ‘warm-up’ exercises
This gentle sequence of warm-up exercises stimulates the cardiovascular system allowing greater oxygen and
nutrient exchange within the body. It also promotes the elimination of impurities by increasing the flow of
lymph through the muscles and lymphatic system. Repeat each of the movements five times and repeat on both
sides of the body or in a clockwise and then an anticlockwise direction.

Yoga Postures
Forward Bend
Stretch your hands above your head and bend forward from the waist. Rest your
hands on the floor (or ankles or lower leg if they won’t reach the floor). Flatten and
lengthen the back towards the buttocks. The knees may be slightly bent but the back
should be as straight as possible. Allow the head to be relaxed with the crown
towards the floor. Breathe into the stretch and relax the shoulders and neck on each
out-breath.

Hip Stretch
Step forwards by about three feet with the left foot. Keep your front knee at
right angles to the body and flex the hips downward towards the floor. Rest
your hands on your knee, have your elbows out to the sides and the shoulders
back. Relax further into the posture on each out-breathe. Remember to keep
the elbows and shoulders relaxed and the neck and back straight. Repeat with
the right leg back.

Warrior Pose
Step forwards by about four feet with the left foot. Keep your front knee at right
angles to the body and flex the hips downward towards the floor so that the back
knee rests on the floor. Link the thumbs and stretch your arms above the head.
Keep the shoulders back and remember to keep them relaxed. Relax further into
the posture on each out-breathe. Repeat with the right leg back.

Triangle Pose
Have the feet three to four feet apart. Turn the right foot outwards by 90
degrees and the other leg by 45 degrees. Keep facing forwards and bend from
the waist side-wards towards the right side - do not lean forward. Place the right
hand on the floor or hold the ankle and stretch the left arm towards the ceiling.
Turn the neck to look towards the left hand. Repeat on other side of body.

Knee Triangle Pose
Have the feet about four feet apart. Turn the foot of the leg you are bending
outwards by 90 degrees and the back foot by 15 degrees. Bend the right knee
and rest the right hand on the ground (or have your elbow on the knee) - do
not bend forwards. Stretch the top arm upwards and look towards the top
hand. Repeat ot the other side of the body.

Knee Pulls
Bend one leg and grasp with both hands - pull
towards the body. Repeat several times with
alternating legs. You can now pull on both
knees together while relaxing the buttocks
towards the floor.

Half Shoulder Stand
Lie on your back and gently raise your hips off the floor and raise your
legs. Support your waist by placing your hands on your hips. Keep the
elbows close in to the body. Hold this position for one minute. Keep the
shoulders relaxed and breathe through the nose in a relaxed fashion. If
this is comfortable you can now attempt the full Shoulder Stand.

47

Shoulder Stand
From the half shoulder stand raise your hand further up the back. Keep the elbows close in
to the body and support the body by pressing the hands against the middle back. Keep the
back and legs straight and extended, locking the chin against the chest. If there is any
discomfort in the neck come down immediately. Always come down with full support of
the arms - lower yourself slowly and gently.

Plough Pose
From the Shoulder Stand take the legs back over the head
and rest the feet on the floor. Extend the arms behind you,
lock the fingers – you may then twist the hands so that the
palms face away. Always come down with full support of
the arms - lower yourself slowly and gently.

Locust
Raise both feet by six inches keeping the
heels together. Now raise your chest, lift
the arms upwards and then link the thumbs
together. You may hold this posture for as
long as is comfortable.

Bow
Lift the chest, bend the knees and grab the leg above the ankles.
Stretch the chest upwards and pull the legs towards your shoulders.
As you gently breathe you will rock backwards and forwards. Do
not attempt this posture if you have any back problems.

Cobra Pose
Lift the chest off the floor and support the upper body
with the arms – do not push with the arms if you have
any kind of back problem or if the lower back is overly
stiff.

Sitting Forward Bend
Extend both legs and stretch the toes towards you. Bend
forwards from the hips/waist - rest your hands near the
ankles and relax the lower back. Avoid overly bending the
upper back, relax the elbows and shoulders and breathe
easily.

Twist
Bend one leg and place the foot by the outside of the opposite knee.
Twist from the waist, keeping the back straight, and place the
supporting hand flat on floor near the hips. The elbow of the other
arm helps support the twist by resting on the bent knee. Do not
twist too far and come out slowly and gently. Repeat on other side.

Rest
Always finish your yoga practice with ten minutes of rest. Lie on your back and relax your lower back,
legs, hips and shoulders. Have your legs two feet apart and allow the feet fall outwards. Have your palms
facing upwards with your hands about twelve inches from the body. Breathe easily into the lower abdomen
and relax.

Try to practice yoga in a warm, clean and quiet environment.
Burn some incense to induce a meditative mood.
Give yourself plenty of time.
Do not practice on a full stomach but eat a light snack if feeling hungry.
Start with a short warm-up exercise routine.
Practice a few cycles of the Sun Salute.
Never strain or over-exert – breathing should be light and gentle throughout.
Ease into postures slowly and gently.
Hold each posture easily for up to two minutes if this feels comfortable and is relaxing.
Always stretch within your own capacity – feel the stretch, ease back slightly and then use the outbreath to gently relax further into the stretch –work within your comfort zone.
Never force a stretch beyond comfort level – forcing is not yoga.
Remember to breathe – do not hold the breath.
Breathe out as you bend forwards or restrict the chest area and breathe in when you come out of a
position or expand the chest area.
Allow your attention to rest on the area of the body being stretched and allow it to relax further into the
stretch on each out-breath.
Become one with the body and feel it relaxing – yoga then becomes a form of meditation.
The pleasant sensation of stretching and that of pain are very different – do not hold a position if
bordering on painful. Pain felt after coming out of a position indicates over-stretching and is not
conducive to progress.
If pain does occur, stop practicing, lie on your back and rest your awareness on the painful sensation –
breathe into this area and allow the sensation to dissolve and dissipate.
If certain positions are uncomfortable at a particular time of day etc miss them out of your routine – try
them again when you feel able.
If you attend regular yoga classes and learn positions you’d like to add to your daily routine feel free to
add them but always remember that a stretch in one direction should be followed by a stretch in the
opposite direction.
After finishing your yoga practice lie on your back for a few minutes and relax.
Gentle breathing exercise (pranayama) and meditation may be practiced after a yoga session.

Above all yoga should be fun

Yoga Nidra
Yoga Nidra means ‘yogic sleep’. It is a state of conscious deep sleep. You leave the waking state, go past the
dreaming state, and enter a deep sleep, yet remain fully alert, aware and awake. It is a kind of ‘psychic sleep’
produced by a systematic method of inducing complete physical, mental and emotional relaxation, while
maintaining awareness at the deeper levels. It is a prolonged suspension between wakefulness and sleep. It
induces a higher state of consciousness - a wakeful state of deep introversion or an inner awareness. It is a
movement of consciousness rather than a deliberate auto-suggestion. You cannot relax by trying to relax - you
need to feel relaxed. After relaxing your body and calming your mind you can plant a few intentions, sankalpas,
or assertions in your subconscious before detaching your mind and experiencing the final stage of deep
relaxation.
There is a close relationship between the body and the brain. Various centres in the brain control modify, and
affect all our bodily functions. In fact, there is a centre in the brain for every act, whether wilful or reflex,
physical or mental. Experimental data have identified many such specific centres. Stimulation of these centres
leads to appropriate actions, be they motor, sensory, emotive or cognitive. Thus we have a holographic
representation of the body on the brain with the left half of the body being represented in right half of the brain
and the right half of the body being represented in left half of the brain.
In Yoga Nidra we make the brain centres active by focusing awareness on the parts of the body in a specific
sequence. Thus, we try to stimulate various parts of the brain by focusing the awareness on the corresponding
parts of the body. Awareness can be defined as adopting an attitude of witness towards physical or mental
actions of the body.
From the Yogic viewpoint the body and the mind (together with the emotions) are so interrelated that they are
actually inseparable. The mind is not simply the thinking process relegated to the brain but is the sum total of the
intelligence which permeates every atom of the physical and subtle organisms. Whatever affects the body must
influence the mind and vice-versa. Since the mind is present throughout the body and permeates its every atom,
the Yoga techniques which we perform to stretch, strengthen and otherwise improve and develop the body must
have a correspondingly profound effect on the mind and the emotions
As we become more familiar with the practice of meditation and begin to perceive the more subtle levels of our
thought process we also become faintly aware of the junction point between relative thought and transcendental
awareness. It is from this threshold of conscious awareness that Yoga Nidra functions and it is from this field
that we are able to carry faint, positive intentions deep into our sub-conscious mind.
Whilst this ancient technique has been part of the Tantric Yoga tradition for thousands of years there are now
many derivations of it in our western world. Most follow a fairly standard pattern of procedures, starting with an
awareness of the breath, progressive relaxation, introducing a subtle intention and then a ‘rotation of
consciousness’ which involves rapidly placing awareness of various parts of the body in a specific sequence.
Yoga Nidra is primarily a technique of subtle intention and directed awareness. We have a very faint intention
and then we very innocently direct that intention with our subtle awareness. The more innocently, faintly and
subtly we are able to do this the more powerful the results. It is a case of ‘do less and accomplish more’ – the
less we try, and the less we allow our minds get in the way of our actions, the easier it becomes to accomplishes
any difficult task.
Our minds are very good at getting in the way of our intentions and often over-ride our intuition which is never
wrong and always works for our highest good. We have almost become brainwashed or conditioned into
believing that the harder we try, the more likely we are to accomplish the desired results. However, this is

51

usually our downfall and often leads to the accumulation of stress, and ultimately failure to achieve our goals in
life. Meditation and Yoga Nidra are both techniques that re-condition and retrain our minds to function on more
subtle and powerful levels – they re-educate the mind and remind it how to function properly. We so easily
forget that some of the most amazing things we do take no effort whatsoever. Take the simple act of moving the
arm above the head – we just do it – we have the intention and the arm moves into exactly the position we
decided it should move. We do not have to think the thought over and over again until the arm finally moves by
shear will power – it just moves in an instant.
Think the word ‘one’ for the briefest of milliseconds and then spend a few minutes faintly observing how the
word remains in the awareness long after you’ve thought the word. A part of you recognises that even when the
word appears to have drifted away completely, it could almost still be there in some dim and distant awareness.
Try the same exercise with ‘orange’ – see an orange in your mind’s eye and notice how the image stays ‘in the
mind’s eye’ long after you stopped the intention of visualising an orange. This is the same level and ease at
which the ‘mantra’ in meditation and the various body-parts in Yoga Nidra are thought – there is no focus, no
concentration and no will power involved. The mind is taken out of the equation and the sub-conscious or
intuitional mind takes over.
As a further example try this little task. Imagine that you are strolling along a country path. It suddenly becomes
very rough and you end up jumping from rock to rock. At one point you realise that the next jump will take you
across a deep cavern, one hundred feet deep with wild, swirling rapids below. Suddenly, actions that had been
automatic now become conscious. The rational, intellectual, thinking mind takes over – it over-rides the subconscious mind which was allowing the body to respond automatically, adjusting each step to land in exactly the
right place for ease and safety. You stop dead in your tracks – the mind’s saying, ‘it’s a long way down, you
could get hurt if you misjudge the next step, turn back, it’s not safe to continue’. However, if our ‘conditioned,
brainwashed’ mind hadn’t taken over we would have just stepped over it, as it was no wider and no harder to
step over than any of the other gaps you’d just crossed.
Similarly, image walking down the same country track and then coming across an electric fence that bars your
way. There’s a sign on it saying ‘beware; electric fence – do not touch’. However, it’s still in the process of
being erected and isn’t yet attached to any electrical source so you could just climb under or over it. However,
your rational mind is telling you ‘don’t touch it, go round’. A part of you knows you don’t need to do that and is
aware that even if the fence was connected to a power source and switched on, it wouldn’t hurt much anyway.
However, you just can’t bring yourself to touch the fence even though you know it’s not electrified. An almost
physical barrier is created which will not allow the hand to move anywhere near the fence – the hand has
surrendered its power to the control of the limited rational, intellectual mind and over-ridden the higherfunctioning, the sub-conscious or intuitional mind.
Meditation and Yoga Nidra are simple techniques that strengthen the mind and help it to remain centred and
grounded in situations such as these. Obviously, these are both extreme situations that most of us don’t normally
find ourselves in but they hopefully illustrate the point fairly well. Less dramatic situations which we may find
ourselves in, or may be able to relate to more easily, could be: panicky feelings before interviews, auditions or
public-speaking; having to apologise or retract our words; picking up a spider or other animal; eating certain
foods or drinking herbal substances we know to be extremely sour or bitter.
Yoga Nidra helps re-educate and strengthen the mind and allows us switch off our lower, limiting conditioned
reflexes in situations such as these. It allows us to act instantaneously and appropriately without the need to
weigh up and evaluate every possible outcome. When we are able to do this naturally our lives become peaceful
and fulfilling and our mind and body remain vital and healthy. We then begin to function at that powerful level
on the very threshold of consciousness where all desires are spontaneously fulfilled.
One of the main practices involved during Yoga Nidra is called ‘rotation of awareness’ during which the mind
quickly observes different parts of the body. From neuro-physiology we know that each part of the body has a

52

different control centre in the brain —curiously, small ones such as the fingers or armpits claim a large brain
area. The movement of awareness through different parts of the body not only relaxes them, but also clears nerve
pathways to the brain.
Another aspect of Yoga Nidra involves alternating opposite awareness of sensations such as heat and cold,
heaviness and lightness. This aspect helps to improve the body's ability to regain balance and brings the related
involuntary functions under conscious control. Visualization is a method of consciously using a symbol or image
as a catalyst to provoke a reaction in the unconscious mind. But since no time is given for the conscious mind to
react, the mind remains detached and the ego becomes temporarily inactive. This phase helps to resolve
suppressed conflicts, desires, memories and sanskaras (karmic tendencies).

The Practice of Yoga Nidra
Practice 10-20 minutes of Yoga asanas.
Practice 10-20 minutes of meditation.
Lie comfortably on your back with your eyes closed, feet apart and palms up. Cover yourself with a blanket to
keep warm.
First you will consciously tense and then relax each area of the body starting with the feet and legs. Lift the right
leg about four inches off the floor. Stretch the toes away from the body and then stretch them towards the head.
Clench the toes tightly. Tense the whole foot and leg and then it relax completely and drop to the floor. Repeat
this with the other leg. Lift the right arm about four inches from the floor, clench the fists and then stretch the
fingers. Tense the hand and arm together and then let it relax completely and drop to the floor. Repeat this with
the other arm. Lift and tense the abdomen and then let it completely relax. Lift and tense the chest and then let it
completely relax. Make a tight face as though you are sucking on a lemon and then let it completely relax. Open
the eyes and mouth as wide as possible and stick your tongue out fully. Now relax the face completely.
Now you are going to subconsciously relax each part of the body in turn starting with the feet. Repeat each of
these phases to yourself as you move around the body. Start with the feet. “I relax my feet, I relax my feet, I
relax my feet” “my feet are relaxing,” “my feet are completely relaxed.”
Use these same phrases as you move to the calves, knees, thighs, buttocks, lower back, upper back, whole back,
shoulders, hands, forearms, elbows, upper arms, head, scalp, brain, eyes, cheeks, chin, abdomen, diaphragm,
intestines, liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, lungs and whole body.

Now start with the number twenty eight and say, “twenty eight, my whole body is relaxing,” “twenty seven, my
whole body is relaxing more,” “twenty six, my whole body is relaxing even more,” “twenty five, my whole body
is relaxing more,” twenty four, my whole body is relaxing more.” Keep counting and repeating similar phrases
until you reach number one. If you lose count start again at number twenty eight.
Next you silently repeat a sankalpa, or resolve regarding your higher aims in life. It should be a short, clear and
precise statement, phrased in positive language and in the present tense. For example, your resolve could be: "I
am taking full care of my family," “I am awakening my spiritual potential,” “I am successful in my all
undertakings,” “I am in perfect health,” “I am a positive help in the spiritual progress of others.” Be aware that as
the resolve becomes embedded deep in the subconscious it is bound to bear fruit in the fullness of time. Repeat
your resolve mentally three times with feeling and awareness.
Now begin the rotation of awareness. Visualize the part of the body mentioned by the instructor; it can be a
teacher or a tape-recorder or even your memory once you are familiar with the process. You should not move
any part of your body; it must remain completely passive and relaxed. Quickly shift your awareness from body

53

part to body part corresponding with the instructions from your teacher. You should not imagine the next body
part before your teacher mentions it. Remain alert, but do not concentrate. The mind must be allowed to quickly,
silently and innocently move from body part to body part with no anxiety or expectation.

This is the sequence:
Become aware of the right side of the body. Take your awareness quickly to the right hand thumb, index finger,
middle finger, ring finger, little finger, palm, back of the hand, wrist, arm, elbow, shoulder, armpit, waist, hip,
thigh, kneecap, calf muscle, ankle, heel, sole of the foot, the top of the foot, big toe, second toe, third toe, fourth
toe, little toe, all the toes.
Now repeat the previous step but this time with the left side.
Bring the awareness to the lower back, middle back, upper back. Become aware of the shoulder blades, the
buttocks, the spine, the whole back together. Now go to the top of the head, the forehead, temples, the eyebrows,
the space between the eyebrows, eyelids, eyes, ears, cheeks, nose, the tip of the nose, lips, chin, throat, right
chest, left chest, navel, abdomen... the whole front. The whole of the right leg, the left leg, both legs together.
The whole of the right arm, the left arm, both arms. The whole body
Throughout this entire process you should have the resolve not to sleep. Say to yourself: "I am fully awake, I am
practicing Yoga Nidra”.
After rotation of consciousness comes awareness of breath. Become aware of your breath, either at the nostrils,
throat passage, lung area or abdomen and gently observe how naturally the breath flows in and out with no
conscious effort from yourself. Simply allow yourself to be “breathed”. Focusing the attention on the act of
breathing completes physical relaxation and concentrates the mind. It also allows the sense centres to withdraw
from their objects of sensations.
Now concentrate on your body, as if seeing it from the outside. Look at your body lying on the floor as an object,
a reflection in an imaginary mirror. Just innocently observe and watch; do not judge.
Now imagine a deep, dark well. Look into it. There is a bucket on a chain. Lower it into the well. It moves into
the darkness of the well. You cannot see it. Now pull the bucket up, out of the darkness, into the light. Now ask
yourself: "What am I thinking?" Do not deliberately think, but just become aware of the thought process arising,
become an observer, a witness to the natural, spontaneous movement of the mind. Now ask yourself “who am I”.
Do not try to answer this question; do not allow the intellect or ego to interfere. Just ask the question, let it go
and allow the mind to remain alert and clear.
Next comes relaxation at the level of feelings and emotions. Here we become aware of intense physical and
emotional feelings and their opposites such as hot and cold, light and heavy, pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow.
First imagine your body is made of light, silky cotton. Your body feels as though it floats above the floor. Now
allow it to be heavy as though it is made of lead.
Now imagine you lie on a beach under the hot sun - awaken the sensation of heat. The whole body is hot. Now
imagine you are in a pool of cold, cold ice - experience bitter cold in the body. The body shivers.
Try to remember an experience of pain, mental or physical - relive it, make it vivid. Don’t dwell on the image for
long, don’t try and judge or analyse it. Now try to remember an experience of a feeling of pleasure—relive it,
make it vivid but don’t try and judge or analyse it.
The last phase of Yoga Nidra relates to mental relaxation and involves a rapid visualization of nature images and
abstract symbols. This practice helps to develop self-awareness and concentration. Be relaxed and innocent and

54

try to visualize the images on the level of feeling, awareness and emotion. Let each image appear like a slide on
your mental screen.
Now begin. Flickering candle… flickering candle… tall palm tree, a car moving on the road, yellow clouds, blue
clouds, starlit night, full moon, standing dog, reposing cat, moving elephant, racing horse, rising sun behind the
mountains, setting sun behind the mountains, setting sun behind the ocean, ocean with waves, a big lake with
crystal clear water, blue lotus, white lotus, pink lotus, a boat sailing on the water—see the ripples, chimney
smoke rising from an old house, the dawn of the day, a yogi in deep meditation.
Now ask yourself again “who am I”. Do not try to answer this question; do not allow the intellect or ego to
interfere. Just ask the question, let it go and allow the mind to remain alert and clear. Become a witness of your
awareness - not the body, not the senses, not the mind; nothing but awareness. Become aware that you are
observing yourself. Look within and try to be aware of the one who is looking.
Now take your awareness to the space above the eyebrows – the third eye, the centre of intuition. Imagine a
flaming golden, sparkling, shimmering light. Breathe in that golden light and allow it to fill your head, your
lungs, your abdomen, your whole body and the space around your body. Take a few minutes just to experience,
appreciate and absorb that pure energy which now fills your whole being.
Now start with the number one and say, “one, my whole body is becoming more awake,” “two, my whole body
is becoming even more awake,” “three, my whole body is even more awake,” “four, my whole body is
awakening more,” five, my whole body is becoming even more widely awake.” Keep counting and repeating
similar phrases until you reach number twenty eight. If you lose count start again at number one.
Now finally repeat once again the resolve or sankalpa that you thought at the beginning of your practice. You
are consciously directing the unconscious mind regarding your true goal in life. This time the unconscious is
very receptive and will therefore accept the suggestion from the conscious mind with more intensity. In due
course, depending upon the sincerity and regularity of the practice, the resolve bears fruit in life.
Relax all efforts, draw your mind outside and become aware of your breathing. Become aware of your
surroundings, the room you are in. Lie quietly for some time and keep your eyes closed. Now start moving your
fingers and toes and stretch your body gently. When you are sure that you are wide awake, sit up slowly and
open your eyes.

Introduction
Every day billions of atoms and molecules are effortlessly replaced and in less than a year we literally have a
completely new body. We therefore have the ability to reverse some of the damage we may have caused due to
our bad habits, lifestyle choices and poor diet. We can interrupt the process of neglect and decay and replace
unhealthy molecules, cells and energy patterns with healthy, life-sustaining new ones.
Once we begin to relax our mind, control our emotions and cleanse our body; especially the gastro-intestinal
tract - we begin to experience better health. The colon is intimately connected to all the tissues and organs of the
body. This is why the simple process of cleansing the colon can so dramatically affect the whole body and
relieve so many of our health issues in such a short period of time.
Poor lifestyle and dietary choices cause the vital systems of our bodies to become energetically imbalanced, our
enzymatic activity to decrease and our digestive capacity to be impaired. As a consequence, the food we eat,
however wholesome, is no longer able to provide the tissues with the nutrients they need to repair and maintain
themselves and our immune system, nervous system and endocrine system all begin to malfunction.
In the short term this may simply result in excess fat, heart irregularities, liver problems, constipation and
indigestion. However, as more toxic material accumulates, especially on the intestinal wall, malabsorption
increases and assimilation and metabolism of nutrients to our cells and deeper tissues are hindered still further.
The long term result is chronic illness, low energy, low self-esteem and a disturbed mind. Fortunately Ayurveda
has many solutions to these problems; the main one being Panchakarma therapy.

How we accumulate toxins in the body
Our bodies are in a constant state of repair and renewal. During this process we naturally produce metabolic
waste which must be eliminated effectively in order to stay healthy. We are also exposed to bacteria, viruses and
other pathogens on a daily basis. As long as our immune and digestive system is strong, healthy and balanced it
is easily able to cope with this onslaught without any adverse reactions or illnesses.
However, if we constantly eat devitalised, refined and processed food; breathe polluted air; drink impure liquids;
take pharmaceutical drugs; entertain negative thoughts; fail to exercise; work too hard; suffer from stress; sleep
excessively; go to bed late; wake late; eat at the wrong time of day and eat foods inappropriate for our body-type,
toxins can build up to levels that the body is unable to cope with adequately. We then become tired and
depressed and begin to suffer from ill health.
As the toxins (ama) build up they begin to solidify and crystallise and interfere with the functioning of the
tissues. Eventually they cause hardening of the joints, muscles and bones, blocking of the arteries and
impairment of the digestive process. Chronic constipation, indigestion, bloating, bad breath, excess weight, water
retention, fatty deposits, cysts, cellulite, anxiety, heaviness, tiredness, pain in the lower back and joints,
persistent headaches, varicose veins and other more serious complaints also begin to manifest.
The white coating on the tongue each morning gives a good indication of the amount of mental stress and
physical toxicity in our tissues. If our digestion is strong and the body is healthy this toxic residue (ama) doesn’t
appear - a newborn baby’s tongue is pink and lacks the white, toxic coating of many adults today.
Ama is essentially undigested food and the coating on the tongue becomes especially thick and profuse if the
colon is functioning poorly. It usually becomes even more noticeable after eating and/or drinking late in the

58

evening. At this time of day the body is unable to digest large quantities of food and undigested residues are left
permeating the bodily tissues. This is one of the main reasons muscles can feel stiff, sore, tired and heavy in the
morning; the muscle fibres are literally tangled or ‘glued’ together by thick, sticky mucus or ama (the same as
the coating on the tongue) and they can no longer glide smoothly and freely over each other.
As soon as we become aware of dis-harmony in the body, whether it be tiredness, stress, negativity, anger,
anxiousness, depression or physical symptoms such as nausea, skin rashes, pain or stiffness, we should quickly
try and redress the balance by reducing the amount of toxins entering the body whilst also reducing the toxins
stored in the body. This can only be achieved by changing our diet and lifestyle, increasing our digestive
capacity, cleansing our colon and detoxifying our bodily tissues. Just changing our diet or taking a few herbal
remedies will be unsuccessful, or at least limited in its affect, if we do not also cleanse the body at the same time.
Once the digestive system has been purified, balanced and strengthened, the ingestion of pure, unrefined foods
and the taking of herbal teas and remedies will start to have the desired affect on the areas of the body we
specifically wish to improve. Our ultimate goal should be to create constant energy, vitality, lightness, love,
compassion and joy which are our inherent birthright and allow us to act efficiently, effectively and
appropriately at all times; they are also the true measure of a healthy mind and body.
To summarise by way of an analogy; perhaps one of the best ways to understand the effects or consequences of
toxins in the body is by viewing it in a similar way to a rain barrel. The barrel collects rainwater and as long as
some of the water is drawn off regularly it will never overflow and damage the area surrounding it. If we view
the human body in a similar way; as long as we don’t ingest and fill the tissues with too many toxins, we can
flush them from our body before any long-term damage occurs to our vital organs. Furthermore, we are also able
to increase the size of the barrel itself through the practice of some of Ayurveda’s more subtle healing modalities
such as rejuvenation (rasayana) therapy, gem therapy, colour therapy, mantra therapy, yoga practice, breathing
techniques (pranayama) and meditation.
On the other hand, if we constantly ingest toxic material over a prolonged period of time the body finally reaches
a point where it is no longer able to process and eliminate them properly and they begin to damage our tissues
and organs. Our health suffers and we become prone to diseases of the mind and body - the barrel is now
overflowing. The longer we ignore the signs and symptoms and refuse to change our ways, the greater the
likelihood of a serious chronic problem developing and the harder it becomes to regain control over the problem.
Twice yearly courses of panchakarma treatments of ten to fourteen days duration help maintain the body in peak
condition – they keep the barrel from overflowing. However, once a chronic ailment had become established it
may be necessary to undertake a Panchakarma program for up to two months duration before the damage is
undone

59

Background to panchakarma
Panchakarma is the Sanskrit term for detox or purification and translates as the five (pancha) actions (karma)
necessary to cleanse the body of accumulated waste material.
It is a special branch of Ayurveda, an ancient Indian system of medicine, which has been in practice for thousands of
years for the purpose of both enhancing health and well-being and rectifying long-standing, chronic diseases. It
rejuvenates and revitalises the mind and body and systematically strengthens and balances all the bodies’ major
tissues and organs using a wide spectrum of therapeutic measures.
The modern trend is to detox the body with herbal concoctions, coffee enemas and colonic irrigation. However, these
methods are often only partially successful as they fail to treat the body in an integrated way and only target limited
organs of the body. They tend to help with the elimination of water-based toxins only and leave the more resistant,
and potentially disease causing, oil-based toxins behind.
Panchakarma treatment however, is unique in its ability to effectively eliminate both water-based and oil-based
toxins from the body and in doing so helps to rejuvenate and revitalise the whole body. Through a series of
therapeutic procedures that are tailored to the client’s individual constitution or imbalance (prakruti) it systematically
helps release, melt, loosen, mobilise and eliminate toxins and impurities from all the bodily issues.
Once our tissues have been cleansed and our digestive fire has been strengthened, the food and herbs we eat are then
capable of being effectively metabolised by the body. Improvement in health is then possible.

For a detox to be totally successful we must first rest the mind and the digestive system as these are our two most
energy-demanding activities. This allows us to maximize the amount of potential energy available for cleansing, rebalancing and strengthening the body. The next step is to gently move waste products and toxins (ama) from where
they are lodged in the deeper structures of the body and to eliminate them either through the nose and mouth
(through nasya & vamana therapy), the gastro-intestinal tract (through enema or basti therapy) or through the pores
of the skin (through heating or sweating therapy - svedana). Finally, we then need to nourish and strengthen the
body. To safely and comfortably flush toxins and impurities from the body requires several important stages.

60

The seven stages of a panchakarma detox
rejuvenation program
Stage one – palliation (shamana)
In order to rebalance the mind and body with these powerfully relaxing and luxurious panchakarma therapies
the digestive system needs to be functioning properly and the tissues need to be cleansed of accumulated
metabolic waste (ama). This is achieved by following a light, easily digestible diet for a period of at least one
week before the main treatment program begins. Herbal digestive stimulants are usually given to enhance this
process and to spark the digestive fire (agni). This pre-detox diet necessitates avoiding heavy foods such as
meat and dairy and eating only light food such as rice, vegetables and lentils (dhal). Light exercise, walking in
the fresh air, meditation and yoga are also indicated. Contra-indications during the seven stages of the
Panchakarma program include: anger, excessive talking, shouting, travelling, sleeping during day, sitting too
long, over-eating, eating before previous meal is digested, unwholesome diet, coitus, excessive exercise, sun
bathing, swimming, extreme heat, extreme cold, windy weather, cold baths and cold drinks.

Stage two – pre-treatment (purvakarma)
Purvakarma involves ingesting a fatty agent (snehana) such as ghee (clarified butter) for several days in order to
gradually penetrate all seven bodily tissues and release their stored toxins.
Day 1: Cleanses the colon of ama and mala (waste)
Day 2: Balances and nourishes the vata areas of the body and calms the mind
Day 3: Balances and nourishes the pitta areas, especially the blood (rakta) and lymph (rasa)
Day 4: Draws toxins from the kapha areas of the body, especially the muscle tissue (mamsa)
Day 5: Draws toxins from the kapha areas of the body especially the adipose/fat tissue (meda)
Day 6: Draws toxins from bone tissue and balances vata (asthi)
Day 7: Draws toxins from the bone marrow and nerve tissue and balances vata (majja)
Day 8: Draws toxins from the reproductive tissue (semen/ovum - shukra)
The snehana substance is taken early in the morning and replaces breakfast. We then eat only when this has
been fully digested – this may be anything from six to twelve hours depending on the amount consumed.
During this phase of the detox it is important for us to eat only when we are properly hungry – often we
experience a ‘false’ hunger which can be eased by sipping hot water.
Meanwhile, eating a light diet, low in fat and calories helps break down and release stored body fat and also
allows impurities within the fat cells to become more concentrated. Because the ingested ghee that is
circulating in the bloodstream is free of toxins and impurities it exerts an osmotic pressure and draws the toxins
from the tissue cells and carries them to the liver and intestines. Light, herbalised oil massage, hot baths and
steam or sweating therapy (svedana) during this time help increase blood flow and allow toxins to be released
and directed towards the liver and small intestine more effectively. These preparatory measures, whilst ensuring
that the body's channels are open so that toxins can move out, also ensure that nutritive substances can move
into the tissues (dhatus). The body is now soft, smooth, light and fluid and adequately prepared for virechana,
the next stage of the Panchakarma procedure.
Note on ghee: this highly nutritious a food source contains an excellent balance of health giving fatty acids. It is
very low in polyunsaturated fat, moderate in monounsaturated fat and is also a good source of vitamins A, D, E,
and K. It has anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties due to its linoleic acid content.

61

Stage three - purgation (virechana)
Virechana is an orally administered, herb-induced purgative treatment that moves acidic secretions and
impurities (ama) from the pitta regions (mainly the blood, liver, gall-bladder and small intestines) to the rectum.
There are many herbs that may be used for this treatment but castor oil is often the purgative of choice as it is
relatively mild and produces the desired affect in most healthy adults. Any physical or mental activity, which
would draw energy away from the gastrointestinal tract, is contraindicated during this process as this severely
limits its cleansing effects.
It is usually administered very early in the morning, or during pitta time when pitta-related ama naturally
accumulates in the pitta regions. If virechana is administered in the late evening, it is taken two to three hours
after a light meal. The meal should be relatively hot, spicy and sour tasting as these tastes help promote pittarelated secretions. By late evening the meal will have reached the small intestine and will therefore allow the
herbal stimulus to exert its cleansing influence on the pitta organs and tissues.
After ingesting the purgative there follows a series of three to fifteen loose bowel movements a few hours later.
The number of movements varies depending on the client’s Ayurvedic constitution and the amount of ama
present in the pitta region of the body. The fecal matter is usually fairly solid at first, but progressively softens
until it is entirely liquid. Mild cramping or burning sensations occasionally occur due to pitta-related ama being
expelled. This can be counteracted by ingesting a small amount of ghee.
If there are less than three or four bowel movements this indicates that ama was not fully eliminated from the
small intestine and virechana therapy needs repeating. If cleansing is incomplete there may sometimes be
feelings of bloating or hardness in the abdomen, itching on the skin, a metallic taste in the mouth, or nausea in
the stomach due to the retention of gas, feces, toxins and waste products in the small intestines. Ginger tea will
help reduce these sensations as will a warm hot-water bottle over the abdomen. Once the bowel movements
become completely liquid they may contain some mucus. This indicates that the small intestine has been
emptied and mucus from the stomach and the kapha areas of the body is starting to come out. Once all the ama,
waste material and toxins have been expelled from the small intestine the purging process ceases and the urge to
evacuate naturally subsides. The body now feels stronger, clearer and revitalized.
Following completion of virechana chamomile or licorice tea is drunk to soothe the intestinal tract and rest is
taken in a warm, relaxed environment. Exercise and sexual activity is contra-indicated and a light diet of rice
water and rice and lentil soup is followed for several days or until full digestive strength returns. It is very
important at this stage not to eat or drink anything cold as this will shrink the bodily channels, aggravate vata
and tax an already weakened digestive fire.
After a successful virechana digestion improves, appetite increases, abdominal bloating and heaviness
disappear, the mind feels calm and clear, skin inflammation clears and the body feels clean, strong and vital.
Virechana therapy promotes metabolism and assimilation by enkindling the digestive fires of all the tissues
(dhatus) whilst simultaneously cleansing waste products and burning ama. It is excellent for all pitta-related
disorders such as malabsorption, acne, dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, leprosy, leukoderma, hyperacidity, colitis,
urticaria, hemorrhoids, headaches, migraine and allergies. It also reduces excessive body heat and acidity,
deeply cleanses the blood, liver and bile, promotes clarity of mind, sharpens the sense organs, strengthens and
rejuvenates bodily tissues and improves digestion. It is excellent for persons suffering from gout, fever, skin
diseases, hematemesis, hemorrhoids, anemia, worms, headaches, chest pains, burning eyes, cataracts, asthma,
jaundice, epilepsy, ascitis, lactation, disorders of the bones and joints and gynecological disorders.

62

Stage four – graduated diet (samsarjana krama)
Virechana treatment temporarily lowers the digestive fire as ama is drawn back into the digestive tract and then
expelled from the body. As weak digestion creates the potential for disease to arise in the first place, it is of
utmost importance that digestion is strengthened at the conclusion of virechana.
In order to re-establish full digestive capacity and prevent the formation of new ama the diet following
virechana must be very light to begin with, and only very gradually increase in heaviness over the following
few days. Only if this procedure is followed properly will digestive strength be maximized, food and medicine
properly digested, absorbed and assimilated and immunity from disease be accomplished.
The diet following virechana therefore starts with one or two very easily digested meals of rice water (Peya).
This is followed by one or two meals of a slightly thicker gruel or watery rice soup called Vilepi. Finally a
thicker soup of rice, lentils, herbs and spices is taken. A little ghee, black salt and jaggary is added to the first
few preparations with fresh ginger, turmeric, cumin, coriander and fennel added in the later preparations to
enkindle the digestive fire.
The final preparation of rice and lentils is called Kichari and this diet is adhered to throughout the whole course
of Panchakarma treatments. Kichari is very nourishing, easy to digest, provides complete and balanced
nutrition, and is suitable for all types of constitution as it balances all three doshas. It strengthens all seven
tissues (dhatus) and aids the detoxification process. It is therefore also recommended during any period of
illness, detoxification or rejuvenation process. The length of time spent on this diet depends on digestive
capacity and is usually determined by the inherent Ayurvedic constitution.
The strength of our appetite is of key importance during this process. Only if it is strong are we are ready to eat,
as a strong appetite is our body's signal that digestion, assimilation and elimination are working well. Those of
a pitta constitution may find their digestion is back to full strength after only three light meals, while a person of
a kapha constitution may find their digestion isn’t back to full strength until after ten light meals have been
taken. Drinking freshly grated, ginger root tea and cumin seeds will also help restore the appetite.
When a graduating diet is followed in this way after virechana the digestive fire (agni) is slowly built up,
enabling it to become strong and powerful. The process is similar to the steps necessary to build a bonfire. It is
started using paper, dried grass and twigs and only when it is burning brightly are larger pieces of wood added.
It is then gradually built up using progressively larger pieces of wood. Once the fire is burning at full strength it
will burn, and reduce to fine ashes, almost anything that is added to it.
Once our appetite it is back to normal we should ensure that we follow the usual Ayurvedic recommendations
for maintaining a strong and healthy digestion. This includes; eating only when hungry, eating until sated and
not until the stomach feels full and heavy, eating the largest meal at mid-day, eating a light meal in the early
evening, avoiding snacking between meals, not drinking cold drinks (especially with meals), eating in a calm
environment, avoiding heavy, fried foods and fasting for a day once or twice a month.

63

Stage five: enema (basti) therapy
Virechana is followed by basti which is the main treatment for nourishing and balancing vata and also for
flushing impurities from the colon. This is a very powerful therapy and Ayurvedic texts state that over 50% of
diseases can be resolved by this procedure alone. During basti, herbal preparations are administered into
the colon via the rectum. However, unlike modern enema therapies, its effect is nutritive and energy
balancing rather than simply cleansing. Due to the preparatory treatments given beforehand, basti
indirectly affects all the other bodily organs and tissues, as the colon is linked to and nourishes,
supports and sustains all areas of the body.
The colon is not only the main organ concerned with the absorption of nutrients and the elimination
of waste material but it is also the main seat of vata, the primary energy that governs all physiological
activities in the body. When vata is functioning normally its movement facilitates the removal of
impurities, toxins and waste matter from the tissues and helps eliminate them from the body. By
balancing the energy of vata through basti we are able to control the onset of disease as we prevent
toxins (ama) from being carried from the gastrointestinal tract into the deeper tissues where they can
generate disease.
Basti therapy is used to treat vata disorders such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
multiple sclerosis, muscular-dystrophy, constipation, low back pain, sciatica, rheumatism, arthritis, gout,
epilepsy and mental fatigue.
The first basti to be administered is the Anuwasan or oil based enema. It is nourishing and balancing to
vata and also lubricates, nourishes and strengthens the tissues (dhatus) of the body. As this is a
relatively small enema (matra basti) it is often retained in the body for over three hours and people
with particularly dry colons will often absorb much of the oil. They are usually administered before
and after the eliminating bastis (niruha or shodhana) as they counteract the more depleting nature of
this powerful purification therapy. Oil based bastis are good for treating problems relating to muscles,
bone, bone marrow and nerve tissue and are often prescribed for chronic neuromuscular disorders.
The second basti administered during a Panchakarma detox is an eliminating water-based enema called a
shodhana or niruha basti. This is a cleansing enema containing ghee, sesame oil, honey, black salt, licorice,
fennel and Dashamula. It removes toxins (ama) that have been drawn into the colon from all the tissues and
organs of the body during the pre-treatment procedures. This enema is sometimes retained in the colon for over
thirty minutes. During this time some of the herbs and oils are absorbed by the colon and serve to purify,
nourish, repair and strengthen the entire body whilst the bulk of the decoction is expelled along with metabolic
waste, fecal matter and accumulated toxins. Each day the cleansing process reaches progressively deeper levels
of the physiology, clearing the energetic pathways of vata, pitta and kapha and nourishing and purifying the
seven tissues (dhatus).
1 st basti:

Cleanses the colon of metabolic toxins, impurities (ama) and waste products (mala).

2 nd basti:

Balances, cleanses and nourishes the vata areas of the body resulting in mental clarity and calmness.

3 rd basti:

Draws ama from the pitta areas of the body, especially the lymph (rasa) and blood (rakta) tissues.
There is greater strength and vitality as rasa is purified and improved skin tone and colour as rakta is
purified.

4 t h basti:

Draws toxins from the kapha areas of the body, especially the muscle tissue (mamsa).

5 t h basti:

Draws toxins from the kapha areas of the body especially the adipose/fat tissue (meda).

6 t h basti:

Draws toxins from bone tissue and balances vata (asthi).

7 t h basti:

Draws toxins from the bone marrow and nerve tissue (meda).

th

8 basti:

Draws toxins from the reproductive tissue (shukra).

64

Stage six – rejuvenation therapy (rasayana)
After the main Panchakarma therapies rejuvenating herbal preparations are prescribed to strengthen the
immune system and increase vitality in the mind and body. Rasayana herbs are often nourishing herbs rather
than cleansing herbs and can be difficult to digest if the body is suffering from an overload of toxins or if the
digestion is weak. Thus, the best time to take these powerful herbal formulas is after a course of Panchakarma
treatments when the body has been cleansed and the digestion is functioning optimally. They are then able to be
fully digested, assimilated and metabolized and able to exert their full potential. Rasayana formulas may be
taken for several months and the specific formulas chosen will depend on your predominant Ayurvedic bodytype or the energy, tissue, system or organ of the body that needs to be strengthened and balanced.
There are many traditional rasayanas; some nourish the tissues, some are rejuvenating, some strengthen the
immune system, some increase strength, vitality and stamina, some balance the nervous system and some
strengthen the reproductive system. The most common rasayana herbs include:
•

Ashwagandha which pacifies and balances vata

•

Amalaki which improves clarity of mind while also balancing both pitta and vata

•

Brahmi and Manjista which pacify pitta

•

Turmeric for purifying the blood, eliminating excess mucus and soothing sore throats

•

Ginger, black pepper and Pippali which improve the digestion and pacify kapha

•

Aloe Vera which cleanses the liver and blood and is good for balancing pitta

•

Licorice for balancing Vata

•

Peppermint for balancing Pitta and Kapha

•

Cinnamon, cayenne, ginger and clove for removing ama

However, one of the most truly magnificent Rasayanas is Chywanaprash or Amrit Kalash which has been used
in India as an elixir of life for thousands of years. Scientific studies have now shown that this amazing formula
has very powerful antioxidants properties and the ability to arrest and improve many of our modern day
diseases such as cancer and auto-immune disorders. Chywanaprash is meticulously prepared with up to fifty
different herbal compounds and has one of the highest concentrations of vitamin C in any natural product. It
balances all three doshas and can be taken on a daily basis to strengthen the physiology and protect the immune
system.

65

Stage seven – post treatment
After undergoing Panchakarma treatments it is imperative that we graduate slowly back to a ’normal’ lifestyle;
hopefully with some healthy additions. This ensures that the delicate state of the nervous system at this time is
not over-stimulated, the tissues are able to re-build themselves properly and energy levels rise sufficiently to
cope with the increase in metabolism necessary for everyday activities. Failing to do this can lead to a drain in
energy levels and an increased strain on the immune system – and we end up feeling worse than we did before.
It is also important that we follow the ‘Ideal Daily Routine’ of waking, sleeping, eating at the proper times,
consuming the right foods for our body-type and integrating exercise, yoga, massage, herbal teas and meditation
into our daily program. If we finish a ten or fourteen-day detox and then jump straight on the plane or into a
stressful office or domestic situation we halt the delicate process of renewal and revitalization before it has had
chance to fully carry out it’s re-integration phase. We then wonder why we feel so tired and become prone to
colds and flu more easily, rather than feel energized and healthy. Once we fully understand the profound power
of Ayurveda, and especially panchakarma, we take the time to complete the process fully and thereby transform
our physiological and psychological resources into storehouses of immense strength and resilience.
Ideally, after panchakarma, we should take at least a week to progress slowly back into our normal daily routine
before we face the world head on again, just the same as we would take a little time to adjust to the day ahead
after waking from a deep sleep or when coming out of a profoundly peaceful meditation. For panchakarma to
be successful we need time to assimilate the benefits and regain our energy levels – we should avoid undue
mental and physical stress, late nights, excessive travel, strenuous exercise, prolonged sunbathing, cold water,
cold or rainy weather and sexual activity for a least a week following the last treatment. If these guidelines are
diligently applied we support and enhance the effects of the panchakarma therapies and assist the body in
concentrating its energy on complete rejuvenation and revitalisation.
We should also follow a light, nutritious, vegetarian diet of pulses, grains, fruits and vegetables to ensure that
digestive system is restored to maximum efficiency and able to eliminate toxins from the body. Once the
digestion is working at full strength the food we eat will be properly digested, assimilated and metabolised.
This will ensure that metabolic toxins, ama and fat are not deposited within the body. We can then be confident
that we are doing our best to remain relatively free from future disease or illness and will be better equipped to
enjoy life to the full with optimal health, joy and vitality.
Finally it should be noted that while Panchakarma may be very successful in alleviating symptoms of disease,
its real goal is to eliminate their cause. An absence of symptoms does not necessarily indicate a complete cure symptoms of disease can often be eliminated or subdued but a complete cure often takes much longer. It is
generally accepted that if a person’s disease has been slowly manifesting over a number of years it will take at
least the same amount of time to completely reverse the damage done and obtain complete relief. To effect real
long-lasting change the person must also review and alter diet, lifestyle, stress levels and negative mental
attitudes, behaviour and emotions in order to eradicate the core and true cause of his illness.

Castor oil
Castor oil, also known as Eranda, is extracted from the castor plant (ricinus commonus) and is native to
Africa and India. It is an ancient medicinal herb and is classified in Ayurveda as sweet and astringent
with anti-rheumatic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. It pacifies vata, liquefies excess kapha
and alleviates pitta problems. Applied externally it easily penetrates, cools and softens the skin,
supporting growth and strengthening underlying connective tissue. Taken internally, it is purgative,
demulcent, anti-flatulent, emetic, mildly expectorant, strengthening and rejuvenative. It pacifies all seven
dhatus and promotes metabolism and assimilation by enkindling the digestive fires of all the tissues whilst
simultaneously cleansing waste products or burning ama. It should not be used in cases of diverticulitis,
ulcerative colitis, diarrhoea, Crohn's disease and pregnancy.
Castor oil is vata and pitta pacifying and thus helps improve the condition and strength of nerve tissue. It
increases intellect, promotes clarity of mind and induces calmness while also acting as a topical analgesic
for neuralgia and sciatica. One or two drops placed in the eyes at night will help with conjunctivitis and
sties.
Castor oil applied to the skin is rejuvenating and helps heal bruises. A paste made from castor oil and
baking soda is good for moles and warts and a castor oil, ghee and neem powder mix (ratio of 4:4:1) helps
with cases of eczema, fungal infection and herpes zoster. It improves complexion by pacifying pitta
dosha and, used during massage, is excellent for gout, lumbago, stiffness, aches and strains. As a remedy
for hiccups an equal mix of honey and castor oil is made and ¼ teaspoon taken every 15 seconds for two
to three minutes. Castor oil packs or compresses on the abdomen will help tone and strengthen the colon
and reduce soreness or swelling and promote menstrual flow. Castor oil mixed with flax oil and mustard
oil may be used to massage mastic tissue to reduce fibrocystic accumulations. Castor oil massaged into
the perineum is good for prostate or cervical problems.
Ingesting castor oil after childbirth facilitates the production of breast milk. For problems relating to the
joints taking two teaspoons of Castor oil with ginger tea at night will help release toxins and promote
strength and flexibility. It will help remove ama and improve the functioning of the colon and, as it is
through this organ that the minerals vital to the nourishment of bone tissue (asthi dhatu) are absorbed, it
will help rectify disorders related to the skeletal system.
To improve digestion, maintain a healthy colon and maximize the assimilation and metabolism of
nutrients to the tissues it is recommended that, once every three months, the colon is cleansed using a
strong purgative – castor oil fulfils this role. It clears accumulated mucus, waste and toxins from the
intestinal tract by promoting strong peristaltic movements followed by a series of loose bowel movements
over the next few hours.
Instructions for taking castor oil:
• Warm 30mls of castor oil (by immersing the container in hot water or by placing on a radiator).
• Take a hot bath at 7am – make sure the head is kept cool.
• Drink the castor oil and then suck on a piece of orange, lemon or lime to prevent nausea and take
away any lingering taste. Drink plenty of ginger tea until you have the urge to eliminate.
• Elimination will usually happen in 1-4 hours (usually 3-10 movements). Stop taking liquids for
the next hour.
• Do not eat until you feel hunger and then have a watery rice soup only for the first meal. The
evening meal should be a thicker rice soup and the meals on the following day should be dhal
soup (kicharee).

Ghee
Ghee is cow’s butter from which the water and milk solids have been removed and can be used for frying herbs,
sautéing vegetables and spreading on toast. Ghee is oilier than butter and very health promoting; it has a long shelf life
and a beautiful flavour. It pacifies all three doshas, strengthens and protects bodily tissue, improves memory, increases
mental clarity, promotes stamina, stimulates digestion, produces a healthy complexion and aids rejuvenation and
longevity. If taken in moderation (1-2 tsp) with each meal it enhances the digestive process but over two tablespoons
per day, especially for a Kapha body type, will clog the system and subdue the digestive fire. In Ayurveda it is often
used as a vehicle to carry herbs into the body; it enhances the absorption of beneficial chemicals and antioxidants into
the lipid-permeable cell membranes. Applied to the eyes, especially during the Ayurvedic treatment of Netra Tarpana,
it can help rectify many eye problems and on burns it helps cool, heal and repair damaged tissue.
Over the past few decades we have been led to believe that all fats are detrimental to health and that they all promote
fat production and weight gain. Scientific research has shown that some fatty acids are in fact very beneficial for the
body while others are absolutely essential. Fats can be saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats contain either longchain or short-chain fatty acids. Long-chain fatty acids may not be totally digested and metabolised by the body and
frequent digestion of products which contain them, primarily meat and dairy may, in the long term, lead to excess
acidity in the body which can result in cancer, arthritis, rheumatism and thrombosis. However, short-chain fatty acids
are digested, assimilated, absorbed, and metabolised very easily and help the body release energy.
Similarly, unsaturated fatty acids, are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Monounsaturated fats are very
healthy while the polyunsaturated are not. This is due to the kind of chemical bonds these fats form - monounsaturated
fats form single bonds and polyunsaturated fats form multiple bonds and this is where oxidation takes place during
heating or processing causing the fat to become toxic. Foods fried in polyunsaturated fatty acids (sunflower,
cornflower etc) become oxidized and toxic; they lose electrons (free radicals) and change the chemical structure of the
oil. These free radicals are believed to be the primary cause of most cancers and chronic diseases prevalent in the
world today. As the majority of vegetable oils contain predominantly polyunsaturated fatty acids it is not advisable to
use them for cooking. Sesame oil, ghee and coconut are an exception as they contain powerful antioxidants and
doesn’t become toxic on heating.
Margarine is particularly unhealthy as it is hydrogenated and contains a large percentage of trans-fatty acids. These
acids, which are chemically altered during processing, are synthetic; they do not occur in a natural form and are
therefore unrecognisable to the body. They have been shown to be associated with heart disease and to increase lowdensity lipoprotein (the bad cholesterol) just as saturated fats do. However, predominantly monounsaturated fatty
acids, such as olive oil, mustard oil, canola oil, and rapeseed oil are associated with the prevention of many diseases
including heart disease and cancer. Ghee contains 25% monounsaturated fatty acids and only 5% polyunsaturated fatty
acids. It contains saturated fats but most of these are short-chain fatty acids with only 10% long-chain fatty acids. As a
healthy diet requires and a consumption of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, ghee is excellent as part of our
daily diet as it contains around 65% saturated fats, most of which are short-chain fatty acids. Ghee is a good source of
vitamins A, D, E, and K whilst also having anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties perhaps due to its linoleic acid
content.
Instructions for ingesting ghee as part of a Panchakarma detox (only if instructed by your Ayurvedic practitioner):
• Take a hot bath at 7am.
• Melt the ghee (30mls etc) by placing on a radiator or in hot water until fully liquid.
• Drink the ghee and then suck on an orange segment to take away the residual taste if desired.
• If you feel very nauseous or have very loose bowel movements soon after taking the ghee do not take the
next day’s ghee and have a day of rest instead.
• Drink fennel, vata or barley tea to enhance the detoxification process and ease any feelings of discomfort.

Maintaining good health
After Panchakarma therapy our digestion is stronger, the mind is less tired and stressed, the immune
system is better able to cope with the demands placed on it and our energy levels are increased. However,
if we wish to maintain this more healthy and vibrant state we should adapt our diet and lifestyle
accordingly. Below are some of the best ways to maintain the benefits of your panchakarma detox and
enhance your long-term health:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

Eat your main meal at midday when the digestion is strong and enzymatic activity is high. This will
ensure that you obtain maximum nutritional value from the food you ingest.
Eat organic, wholesome food which is high in nutritional value and energy.
Eat lightly in the evening so that you are able to process and eliminate toxins during the night.
Drink sufficient quantities of water, especially hot water, to aid digestion and lubricate the body.
Take herbal digestives, rejuvenative herbal formulas, ghee and Omega oils as part of your daily diet.
Reduce the use of refined white sugar, salt and white flour.
Eat less hard cheese, red meat, confectionary, processed food, refined food and micro-waved food.
Reduce the intake of tea, coffee and alcohol.
Leave at least three hours between meals to allow proper and complete digestion of the previous meal.
Meditate twice a day to increase mental clarity and balance the nervous system.
Practice yoga asanas to calm the mind and improve strength, suppleness and flexibility.
Exercise daily to increase circulation, help assimilate nutrients and eliminate metabolic waste products.
Oil massage each morning to pacify vata, balance the nervous system and remove waste products, ama
and impurities that have accumulated during the previous day.
Do not sleep in the daytime as this causes the body to store toxins and become stiff and sluggish.
Do not eat within three hours of retiring to bed or sleep will be unsettled and digestion impaired.
Be in bed before 10pm as this allows the mind and body to be purified, renewed, revitalised and
repaired during the pitta time of night (10pm to 2am).
Awake at dawn (vata time) to imbibe the vibrant and vital energy that is prevalent at this special time.
Try not to wake or get up after dawn as this will allow the influence of kapha to take hold and cause
tiredness and sluggishness later in the day. Whilst sleep is the body’s greatest healer, if it is of a low
quality due to ignoring these natural rhythms and sleeping outside of these hours, the lack of proper
sleep will eventually lead to low energy levels and a build up of ama in the physiology.
Spend time each day walking in nature and enjoying the countryside. The life energy or prana emitted
by the natural environment renews the energy depleted by our urban environment.
Have some quiet time to yourself each day to settle the mind and balance the nervous system.
Maintain the company of like-minded people and reduce contact with stressful people.

As negative thought patterns, especially fear, guilt and anger, are the primary cause of disease and stress
we should try and reduce their hold on us by following as many of the above recommendations as we are
capable of. Some may seem easy to implement and these should be the ones we start with first. Once we
have fully integrated them into our daily routine and are reaping their benefits we will then have the
strength and courage to implement others. Thus, as time goes by, our lives become healthier and happier
and we begin to experience and enjoy the beauty around us.

Panchakarma therapies
During the various stages of a Panchakarma detox a variety of treatments will be given. They involve the
application of warm, herbalised oil through the medium of massage. Many of the massage therapies last
over an hour and are harmoniously administered by two therapists working in tandem, one on either side
of the body. The aromatic oils help loosen and dislodge toxins and impurities stored within the deeper
tissues. Massage therapies may be followed by a second treatment; either svedana - a herbal steam
therapy which dilates bodily channels and mobilises impurities trapped within them - or Shirodhara which
relaxes the mind and pacifies the energy of vata dosha.
The primary oil used in the massage treatment is Sesame oil which has been shown to have powerful anticarcinogenic, anti-melanoma and antioxidant effects. Its potency is increased by a special ‘curing’ process
and by infusing the oil with a decoction of Ayurvedic herbs. The type of massage selected and the depth
and speed of the massage depends on your Ayurvedic constitution (prakruti) or imbalance.
Abhyanga: A full body massage usually administered by two technicians working in perfect synchrony
on either side of your body. Warm, herbalised sesame oil is lovingly and soothingly applied in a
continuous flowing sequence to relax and balance the physiology. The oil penetrates the pores of the skin
and subcutaneous adipose tissues and loosens impurities and toxins which have accumulated there. The
massage may last for over an hour depending on the speed and depth chosen to suit your Ayurvedic bodytype.

The seven dhatus (bodily tissues)
Whilst imbalances in the doshas (vata, pitta and kapha) are the cause of disease the dhatus are the sites of
disease. Our tissues are produced from the food we eat - the waste material or by-product is expelled as
feces and urine. Each tissue develops from the previous one in a progressive cycle from gross to subtle.
Thus, from the grossest tissue, rasa (lymph or plasma) the second tissue, rakta (blood), is formed and
from rakta, mamsa (muscle) is formed. From mamsa, meda (fat/adipose tissue) is formed, from meda,
asthi (bone) is formed, from asthi, majji (bone marrow or nerve tissue) is formed and from majji, shukra
(reproductive tissue) is formed. This process is similar to the production of cream from milk, butter from
cream and ghee from butter – the special cooking of one leads to the formation of the other.
Thus, from the basic plasma of the body, rasa (lymph), all the other tissues of the body are produced –
each is produced from the proper digestion of the other and problems in any one tissue tend to cause
problems in the rest. Also, the more subtle tissues support the grosser tissues and store their concentrated
energy. Thus blood is concentrated plasma, muscle is concentrated blood and fat is concentrated muscle.
The grosser tissues (plasma, blood and muscle) are larger in quantity as only a portion of each is
converted into the next more subtle tissue, with reproductive tissue being the subtlest and most
concentrated and enduring. It takes thirty-five days for the food we eat to work its way through the seven
tissues to become reproductive tissue. As reproductive tissue is the essence of our life-energy and upholds
all the other tissues we need to be extra careful that this tissue doesn’t become depleted.
Plasma (rasa): This tissue is composed mainly of water and is that which all the other tissues of the
body are suspended. When properly maintained it helps nourish all the other tissues in the body,
providing adequate hydration and electrolyte balance. It is the container for kapha in the body and its
main sites are the skin, heart, blood vessels, lymphatic system and mucus membranes. When there is an
excess of plasma, kapha increases and we become prone to accumulations of saliva and phlegm, loss of
appetite, nausea, congestion, cysts and benign tumours. When plasma is deficient we are more prone to
rough skin, cracked, dry lips, dehydration, lethargy, tremors, palpitations, pain and feelings of emptiness.
If we maintain plasma in an optimal state we have a healthy, glowing complexion with soft, smooth skin
and luxurious, shining hair. Balanced plasma tissue creates vitality, stamina, compassion, contentment,
pleasure and a happy disposition generally. It can be strengthened by drinking adequate amounts of
liquid, especially fruit and vegetable juices and in particular lemon and lime juice with a little salt.
Organic dairy products and particularly organic, unpasturised milk is also good.
Blood (rakta): This tissue is composed of fire and water and provides oxygen to the tissue cells. It is
the container for pitta in the body. Excess blood creates skin diseases, abscesses, fevers, inflammation,
bleeding disorders, enlarged liver and spleen, hypertension, jaundice, weak digestion and burning or
redness in the eyes, skin and urine. Deficient states cause pallor, low blood pressure, rough, dry skin and
desire for cold, sour food. In its optimal state is gives rise to a healthy glowing complexion and warm
skin, clearness in the eyes, vitality, love, faith and a passion for life. It can be strengthened through eating
iron-rich foods such as black grapes, molasses, carrots and beetroot.
Muscle (mamsa): This is a heavy, predominately kapha tissue and makes up much of the bulk of the
body – it is composed primarily of the earth element and serves to bind it together whilst giving it
strength for action. In excess it creates swelling or tumours in the muscles, heaviness and swelling in the
glands, obesity, enlarged liver, irritability and anger. It can also impair sexual vitality and cause fibroids
and miscarriage in women. When deficient it creates emaciation, fatigue, lack of co-ordination, fear,
insecurity and unhappiness. In its optimal state we have good muscle development and co-ordination,
mental and physical strength, courage, confidence, openness, forgiveness and integrity. Muscle is fortified
with proteins from grains, beans, nuts and meat.

75

Fat (meda):
This is another kapha tissue which is composed mainly of water but is more refined
type than plasma. It serves to lubricate the body (especially the muscles and tendons) and creates a feeling
of being protected or ‘cared for’ – obesity is often the result of feeling unloved or uncared for; fat acts as
a psychological barrier or protection instead. In excess it also leads to fatigue, asthma, sexual debility,
extreme thirst, hypertension, diabetes, sagging breasts, belly and thighs and lack of mobility. Emotionally
it will lead to greed and attachment. Deficient states lead to brittle or weak hair, teeth, nails and bones,
emaciation, enlarged spleen, cracking of the joints, tired eyes and general lethargy. Balanced fat tissue
creates ideal body weight, mild oiliness of skin, hair and muscles, a melodious voice, joy, humour and a
loving, affectionate nature. It is kept in balance through judicious use of dairy products but more
importantly through using ghee and organic, unrefined vegetable oils such as sesame, flax, sunflower,
hemp and pumpkin oil.
Bone (asthi):
This tissue is composed mainly of earth and air. It functions to support and uphold the
other tissues – it gives them firmness and a strong foundation. Bone is the container for vata in the body –
it resides in the bone spaces. In excess it can create bone spurs, extra teeth, pain in the joints, arthritis,
bone cancer, gigantism, fear, anxiety and fatigue. When deficient it can create dwarfism, poor bone and
teeth formation, low energy, falling of hair and teeth and looseness in the joints. When in balance it gives
stability, confidence, patience, security and stamina. It also gives strong, white teeth, a tall, strong frame
with large joints and flexibility in movement of limbs. It is maintained through eating foods with high
proportions of calcium, iron and zinc.
Bone marrow and nerve tissue (majja): This kapha tissue has an element of earth but is mainly
composed of a refined or subtle form of water, which has the power to convey nerve impulses. It provides
for the secretion of synovial fluid and for the lubrication of eyes, stool and skin. An excess of this tissue
leads to heaviness in the eyes and limbs whilst a deficiency creates weakness or porosity of bones and
pain in the joints. There can be dizziness and spots before the eyes, darkness around the eyes, sexual
debility and feelings of anxiety and emptiness. When in balance, we have a sense of fulfillment and
compassion in life, the mind is clear, sharp and sensitive, memory is strong and the senses are acute and
perceptive. Also, the eyes are large and clear, the joints are strong, pain threshold is high and speech is
strong. It is best maintained through the oils of butter, ghee, nuts and seeds.
Reproductive tissue (shukra):
This is again a kapha tissue and is the essential or causal form of
water – it has the power to create new life. In excess we are prone to anger and unhealthy sexual desires,
semen stones, inflammation of the prostrate and cysts in the ovaries and uterus. A deficiency leads to lack
of vigour, lack of sexual desire, impotence, dry mouth, lower back pain, lack of vaginal lubrication and
slow, difficult ejaculation. Emotionally there can be fear, anxiety and a lack of love and compassion.
When in balance the eyes are clear, the hair is lustrous and strong, sexual organs are well formed, the
body is attractive and we exude a loving, charming, compassionate nature. This tissue is maintained
through taking milk, raw sugar, ghee, nuts, seeds and eggs.

Panchakarma - FAQ
Why do I need to eat a light vegetarian diet during my detox?
A light vegetarian diet allows your body to detox more efficiently and effectively. Your digestive system uses a
large amount of energy when it has heavy foods to break down and digest. If less energy is spent on digesting food
there is more energy available to release metabolic wastes and toxins from your body. Animal products are very
difficult to digest and are therefore strictly contra-indicated during a detox.
Why is it important to also follow a light diet before and after my detox?
A light diet before a detox helps prepare the body for the elimination of impurities. It ensures the body has energy
available to thoroughly detox the body, which naturally begins clearing our waste products once conditions are
favourable. It also ensures that the detox progresses smoothly and effectively without shocking the body and causing
a ‘healing crisis’ (a reaction to excessive toxins being released into the bloodstream and causing the liver to struggle
to eliminate them properly). After a detox a light diet is important because it helps the digestive system gain strength
and efficiency as it gradually increases its digestive capacity.
Why are rice and dhal so beneficial during a detox?
Rice and dhal are light and nutritious and are very easily digested. They take only small amounts of energy to be
metabolised which allows your body to have the energy it requires to detox efficiently and effectively.
Why do I need to take ghee during the Panchakarma detox?
Ghee is similar in quality to the fat in your body. However, it has one the main difference; it has no has no toxins or
impurities stored in it. As toxins gradually build up in your fat tissues they become increasingly more likely to cause
chronic health conditions. However, the ghee circulating in your bloodstream during the early stages of the detox
gradually draws them out ready for elimination.
Won’t the ghee raise cholesterol and make me fat?
No, quite the contrary. Taken in small amounts, especially as part of a panchakarma detox procedure, it will help
reduce the ‘bad’ fat stored in your body and will therefore lead to weight loss rather than weight gain.
Why is ghee taken very early in the morning?
During the early morning your metabolism is very slow and sluggish so the ghee is digested very slowly. It stays
circulating in the bloodstream for longer than it normally would and is therefore able to absorb toxins from the fat in
your deeper tissues.
Why do I need to take castor oil during the Panchakarma detox?
Castor oil has a stimulating or ‘contracting’ effect on the colon and helps induce peristalsis – it therefore helps
eliminate the toxins and metabolic wastes that have been drawn from the deeper tissues by the action of the ghee. It
also cools and purifies the blood and liver and helps eliminate excess Pitta (heat or acidity) from the body.
Why do I need to take Trikatu or Ginger Pickle before meals?
Trikatu and Ginger pickle are digestive aids that promote the production of digestive enzymes in your stomach –
they enkindle the agni (digestive fire) and ensure that the food you consume is fully digested. Trikatu is also very
effective for burning ama (metabolic waste and toxins) which is the prime cause of all disease.
Why do I need to take Triphala at bedtime?
Triphala is an Ayurvedic herbal formula composed of three fruits (Haritaki, Bibhitaki and Amalaki). Together they
help tone and strengthen your digestive tract and promote regular and complete evacuation of the bowels. They also
help increase the digestion, absorption and assimilation of nutrients from the food you consume.
Why is it important to drink hot water during a detox?
Hot water in your body acts in a similar way to hot water applied to your greasy pots and pans – it helps loosen and
dissolve the dirt or impurities and melts the fatty deposits. When it is combined with digestive herbs and fresh lemon
juice it has an even stronger action. However, cold water will cause the fat in your body to congeal and harden and
will therefore result in a lowering of your digestive power, increased deposits of fat in your body and excess weight.

77

Why are bastis (enemas) so important to the success of the Panchakarma detox?
The ancient Ayurvedic texts state that bastis or herbal enemas account for over 50% of the overall effectiveness of
the whole Panchakarma detox procedure. They nourish the colon and deeper tissues (bone and nerves) and help
eliminate toxins and metabolic wastes from the body. They not only release toxins from, but also penetrate and
nourish, the lymph, blood, muscle, fat, bone, nerve and reproductive tissue. They cleanse and strengthen the entire
endocrine, digestive and immune system and thereby cut off disease at its source.
What is Rasayana therapy?
Rasayana therapy is undertaken after your Panchakarma detox treatments to rejuvenate the whole body. After your
tissues and digestive tract have been cleansed your physiology is in a more pure and receptive state for herbal
preparations to nourish and strengthen your deeper tissues and organs. There are many Rasayana formulas but three
of the most common are Ashwagandha, Shatavari and Chywanaprash and these are often recommended after a
course of detox treatments.
What is the purpose of the Ayurvedic massage therapies?
Their primary purpose is to nourish and cleanse the deeper tissues through the application of specialised herbs and
oils. Base oils, such as sesame, coconut, sunflower and olive oil, act as carriers for herbs which have been infused
into them. These herbs target specific dhatus or tissues and rebalance Vata, Pitta and kapha, the energetic aspect of
the body. The lighter, gentler massage therapies help balance the mind and nervous system whilst the deeper, more
vigorous massage therapies serve to stimulate the mind and release deeper-seated toxins and impurities. However,
the body will only release deeper-seated toxins once it is in a relaxed state and this is accomplished through the
lighter massage therapies.
Why can’t Ayurvedic massage therapies be administered in the evening?
Massage therapies are contra-indicated in the evening because your body is in a very sensitive, vulnerable and
delicate stage at this time of day – this is especially so if you are undergoing intensive detox treatments. During
daylight hours massage therapy facilitates the generation and release of energy into your body. However, massage
administered in the evening causes energy to be lost from your body – it depletes your body of vital nutrients and
lowers the immune system. Furthermore, if massage therapy is administered after eating, or before eating, your
evening meal it will interfere with your digestive system and will cause ama (metabolic waste) and toxins to be
created. The person carrying out your massage therapy also suffers in a similar way. Their digestive system will be
compromised and they will suffer from a lack of energy and a build up of toxins the following day. This will
adversely affect the success of your detox treatments as your own energy will be drained as a result.
Why can’t I have massage treatments during the morning of my castor oil detox?
Massage therapy administered during the hours following purgation therapy with castor oil are contra-indicated
because they will interfere with the detoxing that the castor oil has induced in your tissues. The detox process carries
on for many hours, even after elimination has ceased, and it should be allowed to come to its natural conclusion for
maximum benefits. Also, the digestive fire is very weak at this time and even though the oil is applied to the skin, it
penetrates to the deeper tissues and needs to be digested.
Why should I refrain from mental or physical activity (including sex) during my detox?
The more energy your body has at its disposal the more effective it is at flushing out waste materials from your
tissues. Your metabolic rate is reduced during the detox as the action of the ghee, castor oil and basti therapies lower
your agni or digestive ‘fire’. Your body is in a sensitive state during detoxing so mental and physical stimulation
will result in energy being drawn away from the digestive system and will therefore reduce the effectiveness of the
detox.

Other Detox Options - Introduction
The purpose of an Ayurvedic detox is to naturally and gently purify, rejuvenate and revitalise the body
through the removal of toxins, impurities and metabolic waste (Ama). Ama is undigested food and if this
toxic residue is left in the body it interferes with the functioning of the tissues and leads to imbalance,
illness and disease. This creates fatty deposits, water retention, excess weight, painful joints and cellulite.
The goal of an Ayurvedic detox is to systematically release, melt, loosen, mobilise and eliminate these
impurities from the body before they build-up and create more serious complaints in the areas they have
lodged.
A detox creates balance in the body whilst also nourishing and cleansing the intestinal tract. This results
in more available energy for strengthening the immune system and maintaining the body in a state of
relaxation, health and vitality.
The detox diets on the following pages can be safely followed by most people. However, diabetics and
people with sugar intolerances should consult a qualified medical practitioner before undertaking the
‘Lemon Detox’. The diets can be tailored to your own preferences and time constraints – just choose a
diet you feel comfortable with and try it for a few days. It is always advisable to start slow and build up.
It is best to start with the one or two days on the Mini Detox first. If this is comfortable, and leaves you
feeling refreshed and energetic, build up to four or five days the next month. If you are happy on this diet
try introducing the Dhal Detox for a couple of days the next month and on the following month try a fiveday Combination Detox. The options are endless but we’ve given you a few ideas in the ‘Recommended
Options’ page.

This is more intense form of the Mini Detox and can be followed for two to three days each month. This light diet
allows the body to flush out toxins and metabolic wastes even more efficiently and effectively because less energy is
used for digesting heavier food and more energy is available for detoxing.
This detox can be greatly enhanced by also following the ‘ideal daily routine’ – arise at dawn, massage and then
practice yoga and meditation. Yoga and meditation can also be practiced in the late afternoon. Try to rest or have a
light workload on the days you are detoxing and retire to bed before 10pm.

Lemon Detox

This is a purely liquid diet and is excellent for cleansing the kidneys and digestive system, eliminating waste and
hardened material in the joints and muscles, relieving pressure and irritation in the nerves, arteries and blood vessels,
keeping the skin soft, elastic and youthful, promoting weight loss and relieving constipation. It can be undertaken for
one to five days every three or four months. The Lemon Detox is very easy to digest which is why it is so effective as
part of a detox and weight loss program. It provides ample nutrition (vitamins and enzymes etc.) to keep the mind and
body in peak condition with enough energy to maintain a normal daily routine.

Lemon Detox Tea
Squeeze half a lemon into a 10oz. glass and add one or two tablespoons of maple syrup and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne
pepper. Top up glass with hot water and drink each time you feel hungry.

Instructions
For two days before you intend undertaking the ‘Lemon Detox’ avoid alcohol, tea, coffee, meat and dairy products.
On the day before the ‘Lemon Detox’ follow the ‘Mini Detox’ or ‘Dhal Detox’.
During the ‘Lemon Detox’ diet drink the tea whenever you feel hungry (up to ten times a day if necessary).
You may also drink plain hot water or Vata tea throughout the day to aid the cleansing process.
On the day after the ‘Lemon Detox’ follow the ‘Mini Detox’ or ‘Dhal Detox’ for one or two days.

Ayurvedic herbs & oils
~ a glossary of terms & home remedies for health & longevity ~

"When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce.
You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun.
You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person.
But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce.
Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument.
That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding.
If you understand, and you show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change."
~ Thich Nhat Hanh ~

Classification of herbs used in Ayurveda
Herbs used in Ayurveda are classified according to their taste (rasa), their energetic effect (virya), their post-digestive
effect (vipaka) and their post-digestive effect (prabhava). The initial taste (rasa) indicates the properties it possesses and
the therapeutic effects it will have. Thus, a bitter, astringent taste will have a very different action on the body than a
sweet, sour taste or a spicy, pungent taste.
Sweet taste is composed of earth and water and is represented in sugars and starches. It balances vata and pitta,
increases ojas and promotes growth in the body. It nourishes and revitalises the body and creates contentment in the
mind. It is found in almonds, dates, raisins, honey, fennel, licorice, sesame seeds, marshmallow and slippery elm.
Sour taste is composed of earth and fire and is present in fermented or acidic substances. It is heating and increases
digestive power by enkindling agni, the digestive fire. It balances vata, enlivens the mind, increases strength, reduces
bloating and gas and promotes salivation. Typically sour substances are lemon, lime, raspberry and alcohol.
Salty taste is composed of water and fire and is present in salty substances and alkalis. It balances vata, increases agni,
acts as a sedative and laxative and promotes salivation. Salt is found in kelp, seaweed, celery, Irish moss, sea salt and
rock salt.
Pungent taste is composed of fire and air and is present in most spicy, acrid or aromatic substances. It stimulates the
digestion, increases appetite, acts as an expectorant, increases circulation, promotes clarity of mind, kills worms,
alleviates kapha, reduces weight, clears obstructions, opens vessels and relieves blood stagnation. Pungent herbs and
spices include; asafoetida, basil, black pepper, cardamom, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, eucalyptus,
garlic, ginger, horseradish, mustard, onions, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, sage and thyme.
Bitter taste is composed of air and ether and balances pitta and kapha. It is detoxifying, antibacterial and antiinflammatory. It also cleanses the blood and liver, stimulates the digestive fire and scrapes away fat. It is present in
bitter herbs and foods such as aloe, dandelion, echinacea, rhubarb, yarrow and yellow dock.
Astringent taste is composed of earth and air and is present in food and herbs of a constricting nature. It balances pitta
and kapha, stops diarrhoea, stops bleeding, heals wounds, stops sweating and is anti-inflammatory. Astringent
substances include black tea, beans, mullein, pomegranate, raspberry leaves and witch hazel.
Virya is the energy or potency of a herb or spice and can be heating or cooling. It indicates the effect the substance will
have on pitta dosha. Sweet, astringent and bitter tastes are cooling whilst salt, sour and pungent are heating. Heating
herbs increase pitta but reduce vata and kapha. They create sweating and increase the digestive fire. Cooling herbs
reduce Pitta but increase vata and kapha. For pitta they are refreshing and help cleanse the blood as well as calm the
mind.
Vipaka is the post-digestive effect the herb or spice will have on the body. Sweet and salty tastes have a sweet or
moistening post-digestive effect; sour has a sour or heating post-digestive effect and pungent, astringent and bitter have
a pungent or drying post-digestive effect. Sweet tastes are digested during the first (kapha) stage of digestion; in the
mouth and stomach. Sour or acidic tastes are digested during the second (pitta) phase of digestion; in the stomach and
small intestine. Pungent tastes are digested during the third (vata) phase of digestion; in the colon.
Thus, we can determine the long-term effect a herb will have on the body. Sweet vipaka will increase kapha and reduce
vata and pitta; pungent will increase vata and pitta and reduce kapha; sour will increase pitta and kapha and reduce vata.
Prabhava is a term used to describe herbs and spices that have a ‘special’ potency or effect that is unique to it and does
not always correspond to the rasa, virya or vipaka. Thus, a plant may be classified as ‘heating’ according to virya but is
generally known to be very effective during high fever.
In the west herbalists have classified herbs according to their action on the body:
Alterative: These purify the blood and balance pitta and are mostly cooling and bitter. Typical cooling alterative herbs
include: aloe vera, burdock, dandelion, echinacea, manjishta, neem, red clover, sandalwood and yellow dock. Hot,
pungent alteratives may also be used if there is an ama condition present. Typical herbs include: black pepper, cayenne,
cinnamon, garlic and myrrh.

87

Anti-parasitical: These destroy worms, bacteria, fungi, yeast infections and ama and are mainly bitter or pungent.
Typical herbs include: ajwan, asafoetida, cayenne, black pepper, cloves, garlic, pomegranate, pumpkin seeds, thyme
and wormwood.
Aphrodisiacs: These are strengthening, invigorating and rejuvenating to the reproductive system and help nourish all
bodily tissues. They also increase the mental energy and improve nerve function. They include; angelica, asafoetida,
ashwagandha, asparagus, cloves, fenugreek, garlic, ginseng, gokshura, hibiscus, pippali, rose, saffron, shatavari and
wild yam.
Astringent: These are drying and moisture preserving and have a contracting, condensing and compacting effect on
the tissues. Astringent herbs can be classified as haemostatic (stop bleeding), anti-diarrhoea and vulnerary (heal
wounds). Common haemostatic herbs include: hibiscus, manjishta, marshmallow, nettle, plantain, raspberry, saffron,
self-heal, turmeric and yarrow. Common anti-diarrhoea herbs include: blackberry, comfrey, plantain, raspberry and
yellow dock. Others, of a more warming nature and more balancing to vata and the digestive system include: black
pepper, ginger, haritaki and nutmeg and poppy seeds. Buttermilk and yoghurt may also be used. Vulnerary herbs
include: aloe vera, chickweed, comfrey, honey, marshmallow, plantain, self-heal, slippery elm and turmeric. Comfrey,
marshmallow, plantain, self-heal and yarrow are haemostatic, anti-diarrhoea and vulnerary.
Bitter tonic: These are cold, dry, catabolic herbs that stimulate the digestion, reduce heat and clear ama and toxins
from the body; especially the blood and liver – they are usually given in relatively small quantities to people suffering
from pitta related problems. Many are anti-tumorus, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-parasitical. They include aloe
vera, goldenseal, gentian, kutki and neem.
Carminative: These herbs reduce bloating and gas, promote peristalsis and settle the digestion. They work mainly on
vata in the digestive tract and help to increase the digestive fire or agni. Typical herbs include: ajwan, asafoetida, basil,
bay leaves, calamus, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, ginger, nutmeg, oregano, thyme and turmeric. Carminative
herbs with a cooling nature are less likely to produce aggravate pitta and include: chamomile, coriander, cumin, dill,
fennel, lime, musta, peppermint and wintergreen.
Diaphoretic: These are mostly heating herbs that increase circulation and perspiration. They are good for the initial
stages of colds, fevers and flu as they eliminate toxins from the periphery of the body. They help cleanse the subtle
channels and capillaries of the body including the lymphatic system, lungs, respiratory system, sinuses and plasma.
Cooling diaphoretics also help cleanse the liver and blood. Heating diaphoretics include: angelica, basil, camphor,
cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, eucalyptus, ginger, sage and thyme. Cooling diaphoretics include: burdock, chamomile,
coriander, horsetail, peppermint and yarrow.
Diuretic: These promote urination and reduce water and toxicity in the body through increasing the action of the
kidneys and urinary bladder. They are kapha or pitta reducing herbs and are bitter, astringent or pungent in taste. In
regard to pitta they dispel damp heat, cool and purify the blood, reduce acidity, control diarrhoea and dysentery and
help in conditions related to the liver and gall bladder. Cooling diuretic include: asparagus, barley, burdock, coriander,
dandelion, fennel, gokshura, horsetail, marshmallow, plantain, punarnava and parsley. Heating diuretics include: ajwan,
cinnamon, garlic, mustard and parsley.
Emmenagogues: These are pitta balancing herbs that promote the flow of blood and are indicated for problems related
to the female reproductive system, especially the menstrual cycle. Cooling emmenagogues include: chamomile,
hibiscus, manjishta, musta, raspberry, rose and yarrow. Heating emmenagogues are indicated when causes are more of a
vata nature and include: angelica, asafoetida, cinnamon, ginger, myrrh, parsley and turmeric.
Expectorants: These promote the flow of phlegm and mucus from the lungs, nasal passages and stomach and are
therefore indicated for colds, flu, cough, asthma, bronchitis and digestive complaints relating to mucus. They mainly
help reduce kapha through their drying, warming nature and include herbs such as: calamus, cardamom, cinnamon,
cloves, eucalyptus, ginger, pippali and thyme.
Demulcent: These herbs are mucilaginous and alleviate dryness. They are softening, strengthening, nutritive and antiinflammatory and help feed the mucus membranes and connective tissue to heal wounds, sores and ulcers. They can
also act as moistening expectorants in cases of dry cough. Herbs include: bamboo, chickweed, comfrey root, flaxseed,
licorice, marshmallow and slippery elm.

88

Laxative: These are used in cases of constipation and toxins in the colon as they promote bowel movement and
peristalsis. Purgatives have a stronger action and are generally cold and bitter; they may cause diarrhoea and gripping
and include: aloe vera powder, castor oil, rhubarb and senna. Milder laxatives are used in more general vata conditions
and include: bran, flaxseed, ghee, licorice, prunes, psyllium seeds, raisins, shatavari, warm milk and yellow dock.
Nervines: These act upon the nervous system. They either stimulate or sedate the mind and have an anti-spasmodic
effect on muscle tissue. They can help with menstrual cramps, headaches, muscle tremors, nerve pain, lumbago and
sciatica. Heating nervines pacify vata and kapha dosha and include: asafoetida, basil, calamus, camphor, eucalyptus,
garlic, guggul, myrrh, nutmeg, poppy seeds, sage and valerian. Cooling nervines help pacify pitta dosha and include:
bhringaraj, chamomile, gotu kola, hops, jatamamsi, mullein, peppermint, sandalwood, St.John’s Wort and wild yam.
Stimulants: These are herbs that promote digestion by stimulating agni, the digestive fire. They are mainly heating and
pungent and are the best herbs to increase appetite and digest ama or toxins. They increase energy, stimulate the senses
and generally increase pitta and decrease kapha. In excess they can disturb vata. Stimulating herbs include: ajwan,
asafoetida, black pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, ginger, horseradish, mustard and pippali.
Nutritive tonics: They nourish the body and increase body mass and are usually sweet, heavy, oily, mucilaginous and
kapha increasing. They can increase ama and reduce the digestive fire and are often combined with more stimulating
herbs to counteract this in certain conditions. Nutritive tonics include: almonds, amalaki, angelica, bala, coconut,
comfrey root, dates, flaxseeds, ginseng, honey, Irish moss, licorice, jaggary, marshmallow, milk, raisins, sesame seeds,
shatavari, slippery elm and wild yam.
Rejuvenative tonics: These are some of the most important herbs or Rasayanas in Ayurveda and are said to increase
the subtle qualities of the mind and body, bringing longevity, renewal and revitalisation. They increase the subtle
essence of life in the body, ojas and bring clarity to the mind and strength to the body. Rasayanas for vata include:
ashwagandha, bala, bhringaraj, calamus, chywanaprash, guggul, haritaki and triphala. Rasayanas for pitta include: aloe
vera, amalaki, brahmi, gotu kola, guduchi, saffron and shatavari. Rasayanas for kapha include: bibhitaki, guggul, pippali
and triphala.
When an Ayurvedic practitioner has a client with a particular complaint he will aim to determine the underlying cause
of the problem and not focus primarily of the disease itself. He will establish which dosha has gone out of balance and
then suggest lifestyle and dietary changes to help bring the offending dosha back into balance. He may also suggest
ingesting herbal formulas to speed the process along and his choices will be based on the energetic qualities of the herbs
used. Thus, if the underlying dosha that is causing the problem is vata, which has the qualities of bitter, light, cold and
dry, he may prescribe herbs that have opposite qualities to this; sweet, heavy, warming and moistening. He will also
take into account whether heating or cooling herbs (vipaka) are more appropriate and also whether there are any herbs
with special properties (prabhava) which may be indicated.
It is usual for an Ayurvedic herbal formula to have many different herbs in it, each creating a particular effect and
complementing or balancing one another. If a herb is specifically known to treat the particular condition (prabhava) this
will form a relatively large part of the herbal formula. Other herbs will be added to treat the imbalanced dosha, whilst
others may be added to treat the tissues (dhatus) and channels (shrotas) involved. The state of the digestive fire (agni)
and the amount of toxicity (ama) in the body will also be given due consideration and the necessary herbs added. Thus,
some traditional herbal formulas have as many as fifty herbs in them. The vehicle that is used as a carrier for the herbs
is also very important so hot water or milk may be use to target vata, aloe vera to target pitta and honey to target kapha.
The time of day the herbs are taken affects the manner in which the body will respond as a herbal formula may act on
one particular tissue or dosha at 6am and another at 6pm. Also, herbs taken before a meal may have a very different
action on the physiology if taken during or after a meal.

91

Triphala
Triphala formula contains Amalaki, Haritaki and Bibhitaki is considered a 'tri-doshic rasayana' – it is one of the most
popular Ayurvedic herbal remedies as it helps rectify constipation and bowel irregularity but is also something of a
universal panacea for a wide range of complaints.
It helps cleanse the blood and detoxify the liver as it possesses bitter anthroquinones which help stimulate bile flow and
peristalsis. It is a powerful tonic as it is high in vitamin C, linoleic oil, phospholipids and other important nutrients. It is
rich in antioxidants that fight free radicals and has anti-viral (HIV, AIDS, herpes etc) and anti-bacterial properties. It
tonifies and protects the heart whilst also lowering blood pressure and reducing fat and cholesterol. It helps with the
digestion and assimilation of food, improves blood circulation and has anti-inflammatory properties. It revitalises the
whole body by removing toxins, gas and distension whilst nourishing the nervous system. It is good for anemia, fatigue,
candida, cancer, allergies, constipation, diarrhoea, yeast infections, indigestion and skin disorders. It can be used for all
eye diseases including conjunctivitis, progressive myopia, glaucoma and cataracts.
Traditionally triphala is taken as a churna or powder as the taste on the tongue is important to its action. Two or three
grams of the powder can be taken daily with warm water for health maintenance (alternatively, 1g can be taken three
times a day between meals). Larger doses are more laxative whilst smaller doses are more gradually blood purifying.
The dose taken should be increased or decreased according to the response of the bowels.

Aloe Vera
Known to herbalists and medical folklorists for centuries as the "medical plant" or "the potted physician", this cactuslike plant whose name means "shining bitter substance," was widely regarded as a master healing plant. In recent
decades medical research has confirmed that Aloe Vera is a truly amazing plant with an incredible array of medicinal
healing properties.
Applied to wounds, aloe gel is a mild anaesthetic, relieving itching, swelling, and pain. It is also antibacterial and anti
fungal, increases blood flow to wounded areas and stimulates fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for wound healing.
It also helps relieve burns and psoriasis. It is effective for treating inflammatory bowel disease, detoxifying the bowel,
neutralising stomach acidity, relieving constipation and healing gastric ulcers. It has also been shown to reduce blood
sugar in diabetics.
Aloe can help prevent arthritis and reduce the inflammation in joints already affected by arthritis. It can also inhibit the
autoimmune reaction associated with certain forms of arthritis, in which the body attacks its own tissues.
Aloe could also provide nutritional support for HIV patients as it has properties which reduce occurrences of
opportunistic infections, thrush, fatigue and diarrhoea. Research indicates that aloe helps stimulates the body's immune
system, particularly the T4 helper cells - white blood cells that activate the immune response to infection. An extract of
mannose, one of the sugars in aloe, has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 (the virus associated with AIDS).
Aloe has been found to significantly suppress the growth of cancer cells. It has been shown to help turn on the immune
system by activating macrophages (white blood cells which "swallow" antigens), causing the release of immuneactivating (and anticancer) substances such as interferons, interleukins, and tumour necrosis factor. In addition, aloe
seems to also promote the growth of normal (non-cancerous) cells.

A guide to using aromatic essential oils
Essential oils are an aromatic constituent of many plants, flowers and shrubs and have powerful healing properties if
distilled and applied correctly. Only organic, grade A (clinic/therapeutic grade) oils with ISO/AFNOR certification
should be used if you wish to ensure that the oils you purchase will be safe and have the desired therapeutic effect. If
essential oils meet the above criteria then many may be safely used to flavour beverages or food, added to base oils for
massage, mixed with bathwater, evaporated in aroma burners, applied topically to the body and inhaled from diffusers.
To prepare a herbal tea, add one or two drops of essential oil to a one-litre thermos flask. Be sure to only use oils that
are recommended for oral consumption. When using essential oils on the skin it is best to mix them with a base oil such
as sesame or almond in order to prevent possible skin irritations or sensitivity and also to increase their therapeutic
value (a mix of 20:1 base oil to essential oil is ideal). If used neat on the skin it is important to test on the back of the
hand first to check for skin sensitivity. Do not use undiluted anywhere on the skin if a reaction occurs.
Serious complaints and imbalances in the body have often taken many months or even years to manifest as physical
symptoms. Essential oils can help heal the underlying problem and can thereby reduce or eliminate the outward
symptoms. However, this healing and balancing process may take weeks or even months depending on the severity of
the problem being tackled so patience and perseverance are vital. Prescribed drugs may well clear up outward
symptoms of a disease very quickly but they are generally toxic to the body and can further weaken an already
compromised immune system. Furthermore, they don’t often address the underlying problem but simply suppress the
condition and drive it even deeper into the tissues. As with any medical condition, the disease, illness or complaint is
both a warning sign that you are treating the body incorrectly and also the body’s way of releasing toxins or impurities.
If you suppress that process with drugs you have a short-term gain but a dangerous long-tern loss because the real
problem hasn’t been addressed and dealt with.
The causes of specific ailments or conditions are manifold but are often a combination of wrong diet, wrong lifestyle,
stress and lack of exercise. Eating well-balanced, freshly cooked, nutritious meals, reducing stress levels and exercising
regularly go a long way to preventing the onset of disease processes. However, the judicious use of essential oils will
undoubtedly help with any complaints or conditions you may be suffering from. However, herb and oils are powerful
remedies and should only be taken or applied after first consulting with a qualified herbal practitioner, especially in
pregnancy or if taking any kind of medication.
Commonly used essential oils:
Basil: Use for migraines, mental fatigue, scanty periods, relaxing muscles, insect bites and chest infections. Apply
diluted to the temples, crown, forehead, heart and navel. May be added to food and water. Balances Vata and Kapha.
Cederwood
Good for combating hair loss, insomnia, skin problems, nervous tension and anxiety, dandruff, cystitis and fluid
retention. Apply diluted to problem areas. Balances Vata.

Nasya home treatment
Nasya is the nasal administration of medicinal herbs, decoctions and oils to alleviate complaints that occur above the
clavicle. This therapy is most commonly indicated for dry nasal passages, hoarseness of voice, stiffness in the head,
neck and jaw area, headaches and certain eye and ear problems. It relieves mental and emotional stress, anxiety, fear
and negativity.
The nose is the doorway to the brain, mind and consciousness. Prana, the vital life force, enters our bodies through the
breath. Lubrication of the nasal passages with medicated oil provides subtle moisture to the air we breathe and affects
the higher cerebral faculties and sensory organs. It promotes clarity of perception, intuition and stimulates memory. It
also enhances cerebral circulation and restores prana or life energy to the senses.
This self-treatment can be undertaken weekly (from one to three days duration) if you frequently suffer from mild
headaches, congestion or blocked sinuses. However, it is contra-indicated during colds/flu, high fever, pregnancy and
menstruation and should only be used under medical supervision if highly congested.

You will need:

MP16 (nasal oil)*
MA634 or eucalyptus oil (inhalation oils)*
Sesame oil*
Box of large tissues
Salt water
Hot water bottle
Steam bowl
Boiling water
Bath towel
Hand towel x 2
1 dropper (for applying oil into nose)
* available form MAP (see resources section)

Instructions:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Vigorously massage the head with warm sesame oil for 5 minutes.
Fill a large bowl with hot water and add 1-2 drops of eucalyptus or MP634 oil.
Place a towel over the head and bowl to keep the steam in and gently inhale the steam.
Continue for 5-10 minutes - add more hot water and/or inhalation oil if required.
Fill a large bowl hot water. Fold a hand towel four times (lengthways) and place in boiling hot water – make sure
the ends are not placed in water. Hold the ends of the towel and wring out the hot water.
6. Open up the towel and shake briefly to cool it down to a comfortable temperature for placing on the skin.
7. Fold in half, lengthways. Lie down on bed and wrap the hot towel around the head, avoiding the eyes.
8. Repeat two more times.
9. Remove the towel and dry the face thoroughly.
10. Lie on a bed with the head hanging over the end and apply one drop (from dropper) of MP16 or ‘Shakti’ (see recipe
below) into each nostril.
11. Pinch both nostrils, start to inhale and immediately remove fingers to allow for a deep inhalation – repeat several
times to allow substance to penetrate sinus cavities.
12. Massage the forehead, above and below the eyebrows, on the sides of the nose and under the cheekbones.
13. Cough up and spit out any mucus that forms in the throat – blow your nose if necessary and do not suppress
sneezing (have your tissues handy).

100

14. If there is a burning sensation in the throat gargle with salt water and tilt head further back next time you insert the
nasya substance.
15. Repeat steps 10 – 13 but with two drops of oil. You may increase to three, four and eventually five drops if this
feels comfortable (or until there is some mucus discharge).
16. Never continue if the nose becomes completely blocked, a headache develops or you experience other unpleasant
effects.
17. Finish by gargling with salt water and then keep head warm and dry for rest of the day.

Alternative nasya treatments:
If you do not have the time do the full Nasya therapy you may simply lie on the bed with your head tilted back and
follow the instructions for inserting the nasya drops. This is obviously less effective but still very beneficial. This may
be done daily when there is congestion and weekly as a preventative measure.
Another method of administration of nasya oil, when lying down is not convenient, is to simply place a drop of nasya
oil on the little finger and gently insert it into the nostril and inhale fairly forcefully. Next, gently massage the inner
walls of the nasal passage. Alternate left and right nostrils until each nostril has received a total of three applications of
oil. The lubrication and gentle massage helps to alleviate stress and release any tension in the tissues. This may be done
daily as a preventative treatment.
It is not recommended to use nasya oil immediately following the neti pot wash, especially if these therapies are new to
you – alternate days may be better. By taking just five minutes a day to incorporate this simple treatment into your daily
ayurvedic regime, you can enjoy the many healing benefits of the full nasya therapy.

Recipe for Shakti:
On a low heat slowly warm 15mls of sesame oil in a small pan with ¼ level tsp ground ginger, ¼ level tsp ground black
pepper and ¼ level tsp ground clove. Remove from heat before it starts to smoke (about one minute) – cool for 30secs
– reapply to heat for 10 secs – cool again for 30 seconds – heat again for 10 seconds and then allow to cool to body
temperature. If the oil starts to smoke or burn at any stage throw the mixture away and start again. Strain the mixture
through a muslin cloth, allow to cool and then place in a small glass bottle (with dropper top). The bottle and mixture
can be warmed slightly (to body temperature) in hot water just before use.

101

Skin brushing, tongue scraping & sinus cleansing
The following procedures are also important as part of a daily detox – skin brushing helps detoxify, tone and improve
the skin, tongue scraping helps detoxify the body in general and a nasal wash cleans the sinus and helps prevent colds
and congestion.
Skin Brushing (for Kapha): Skin brushes can be purchased from most chemists. Each morning, either before or after
bathing/showering, brush the skin for 2-5 minutes. Brush upwards towards the heart and use circular motions on the
joints and long strokes on the arms and legs. Work up the body starting with the feet and legs. The hands and arms
come next followed by the back and sides. The back can be best scrubbed using a long-handled brush (use circular
motions on the lower back). Now massage the abdomen using slow circular motions and up and down motions on the
sternum. When you first begin skin brushing the bristles may feel very rough – the body soon gets used to this and after
a few days you’ll really begin to enjoy this pleasant invigorating experience. The bristles naturally soften after a few
massage sessions but you can run the brush under hot water if you really want a softer feel.
Tongue Scraping: Use a stainless steel or silver scraper and gently remove the white coating from the tongue each
morning before you clean your teeth. This white coating is ‘ama’ or undigested food and it often the cause of bad
breath. Once these toxic substances have been removed the breath improves and feels fresher, the taste buds come to
life and the digestion benefits from not having to cope with as much bacterial/toxic waste.
Gargling: Gargling with a small amount of sesame oil and coating the inside of the nostrils with a smear of oil with
your little finger helps prevent viruses and bacteria from entering the body. It is a great preventative measure against
colds and flu.
Nasal cleansing: Regular use of a Neti Pot cleanses the sinuses of old congested mucus and dirt and enables the breath to
flow more freely through both nostrils. It is therefore an invaluable aid to yoga, pranayama and meditation and also in
helping prevent allergies, asthma, colds and flu. To use, mix ¼ tsp of non-iodized salt with lukewarm water in your Neti
Pot. Bring the spout to your nose, bend forward over the sink or bath with the head tilted to one side and slightly
forward. As water begins to flow through into the upper nostril, make slight adjustments to the head and Neti Pot
position until water to flows out of the other nostril. If the water enters your throat, instead of out of the other nostril,
simply make further alterations to the position of your head and Neti pot until it flows properly. Repeat for the other
nostril. It helps to start by cleansing the nostril on the side that feels freer and less blocked with mucus.
After cleansing the nostrils blow the nose freely through both nostrils to clear the nose of excess water and mucus.
Don’t close off one nostril when doing this as this may allow water to enter the ear channels. This is unlikely to happen
but should this or any other problems occur during this process, kneel down and bring your forehead to the floor. Raise
the hips above the level of the head and blow freely through both nostrils as before - it may help to turn the head to
either side when doing this.
A second technique to try, once proficiency is gained in the above method, is to direct water from the nose and out
through the mouth. As in the previous method, make slight adjustments with the head and Neti pot until water flows
into the mouth – then spit it out.
Benefits of nasal rinse:

Removes mucus and pollution from nasal passages and sinuses
Daily use relieves allergies, colds and sinusitis
Cooling and soothing to the mind
Helps prevent respiratory tract diseases
Beneficial in the treatment of headaches and migraines
Alleviates anxiety, anger and depression
Removes drowsiness, making the head and sense organs feel light and smooth

Meir Schneider and the ‘Bates Method’
Meir Schneider was born with cataracts and by the time his eyes were operated on, at the age of four, his brain had lost
the opportunity to develop the ability to see. He had already developed nystagmus, which is involuntary movement of
the eyes, glaucoma, which is high pressure in the eyeball, and cross-eyes. The surgery, and the four operations that
were done later, scarred his lenses to the extent that light could hardly penetrate through them. By the age of 7 he was
declared legally blind for life, and for the next ten years did all his reading in Braille. Today he can even read the small
print on his unrestricted driver's licence. Meir broke boundaries and proved that eyes cannot only get worse, as is the
common belief, but can also improve.
At the age of 17 Meir was introduced to vision improvement exercises, a method developed by Dr. William Bates over
100 years ago. In his studies of visual function, Bates observed how people behaved visually when they see perfectly
and based on these observations, he developed a series of exercises to mimic optimal visual behaviour. He also learned
how people create refractive errors - nearsightedness (myopia) far-sightedness (hyperopia), middle-age farsightedness
(presbyopia), and astigmatism. In every case of refractive error he found "a strain of the mind" that was held in the
body, the face, and especially the eyes. This anxiety, he found, was relived and relayed continuously along the body's
neural pathways. To relieve chronic tension in the eyes, as in the rest of the body, Bates hypothesized, one must learn
to use them properly and to relax them often; every Bates exercise is a relaxation technique.
Probably Bates' greatest gift was his ability to view medicine in a different light. Organs that could be seen as
mechanical objects: the eye as a camera or the heart as a pump, could also be viewed holistically, as parts of an
interdependent system. The body could be seen as intrinsically passive, and so requiring health care (drugs, surgery,
corrective lenses) or as living tissue, with a built-in consciousness and a capacity for learning. Bates favoured the latter
view.
It was already known in Bates' time that the tissue of the retina, the back of the eye where light falls on photosensitive
cells, is brain tissue. The parts of the brain associated with vision are as much a part of the visual apparatus as the eyes
are. In fact the brain is the dominant part of the visual system and Bates reasoned that seeing is psychological
behaviour, which can be done well or done poorly. "We see very largely with the mind," he wrote, "and only partly
with the eyes”. Vision depends on the mind's interpretation of the impression on the retina. What we see is not that
retinal impression but our own interpretation of it. But when, as a coping response that has become habitual, the mind
refuses to let the eye see properly, a deliberate act of imagination can help.
Thus, Bates would invite patients to appreciate and visualize the forms and blackness of letters on an eye chart until the
patients would at last give themselves permission to relax and see the letters. With the help of a retinoscope, which
allows the user to determine the degree of visual clarity and nature of the subject's refractive error, Bates checked
hundreds of thousands of eyes and the results surprised him. He found that normal 20/20 vision wasn’t constant and
none of the eyes he examined had perfect vision around the clock. Normally sighted eyes drifted off to moments of
farsightedness, nearsightedness, and astigmatism, and then picked up again to 20/20. Bad vision got worse, got a little
better, and even had flashes of perfect vision. Temporary anxieties often produced refractive error.
Bates had been taught that in daytime, full colour vision is sharpest in a small area in the centre of the retina called the
macula, especially in the tiny centre of the macula, the fovea. The macula is sculpted into a parabolic receiver - like an
antenna dish, but for light - with the fovea at the pit. Vision at the fovea is 20/20; 10 degrees off centre, it is 20/4000,
within the realm of legal blindness. The correctly functioning eye sees the small detail it is focusing on best - a
characteristic called central fixation. To see many details equally well, a correctly functioning eye will flit rapidly from
one sharply realized detail to another; Bates called it shifting. Good daytime vision is passive and effortless, consisting
of automatic and continual central fixation and shifting. The poorly functioning eye overstrains and then numbs the
macula until it has lost central fixation.
The exercises that he devised release the tension from over-strained eyes and help regain central fixation ability.
There are now Meir Schneider centres teaching ‘The Bates Technique’ all around the world.

Eye exercises
Sleep in the dark: Curtains should shut out streetlights; the eyes get full rest only in darkness.
Palming: Rub your hands together, close your eyes and gently cover them with your hands so you block out all light but without
pressing on the eye. Breathe easily and picture a black object – imagine this object on a black background and then paint the world
black. Do this whenever the eyes need relaxing.
Peripheral vision: Take a black piece of paper four inches square and stick it between your eyebrows so you can't see in front of
you. Sit in a dark room and rapidly move two flashlights out to either side of you while looking straight ahead. As your peripheral
vision improves, increase the challenge by moving the flashlights further back. Alternatively you may do this exercise in normal light
and substitute waggling movements of the fingers for the movement of the flashlights. This exercise will improve your peripheral
vision and train both eyes to work together.
Shifting: Look at a picture on the wall in a relaxed way and move your attention from one small detail to another. Then close your
eyes and visualize what you have just seen. Repeat. The same brain cells work for visualizing as for seeing and this exercise helps
retrain them and strengthens the macula.
Blinking: Sit easily, breathing gently and blink rapidly one hundred times - then close the eyes and visualize blinking a hundred
times. Repeat. This massages and cleanses the eyes. In times of stress, just when blinking and relaxed breathing would be most
useful, we are most likely to suspend these essential functions.
Focusing: Place the index finger 6 inches in front of the eyes and, for approx 30 seconds, alternate your focus from your finger to an
object on the horizon. This should be simple and smooth with no strain or discomfort. The speed of alternating may increase as
strength of eye muscles improve.
Far-Reading: Place some reading material on a wall, relax, breathe easily and read from a distance that is comfortable – increase the
distance gradually each day (read for 30 seconds).
Near-Reading: Relax, breathe gently and place reading material at the nearest distance that is comfortable to read from. Decrease
distance very gradually each day (read for 30 seconds).
Colours: With eyes CLOSED look towards sun (or full spectrum light) for 30 seconds and then turn away. Watch the colours in a
relaxed and gentle way– massage eyes – watch colours again (for as long as is comfortable). Repeat.
Eye positioning: Hold eyes in a relaxed fashion for 30 seconds in each direction - look up-left; look down-left; look up-right; look
down-right; look through third eye/centre of eyebrows; focus on tip of nose; imagine looking at tongue. Do not strain and look for as
long as is comfortable. Increase time each day if comfortable (30 secs max.).
Tramlines: Draw a circle with tramlines and place on a wall in front of you. Now circle the eyes clockwise round the train-line for 30
seconds. Repeat in an anti-clockwise direction.
Dotting: Draw a circle and randomly place a few dots within the circle. Place the paper on a wall in front of you. Now allow the
eyes to randomly follow the dots in no particular sequence as in dot-to-dot. Now do this with the eyes closed.
The cat: Bring the face of the cat and the body of the cat together by altering focus – go half cross eyes but while looking at cat in a
relaxed fashion. Don’t try too hard or strain – be relaxed and breath normally – this may take time to master.

104

Caring for the eyes
Netra program
This program can be undertaken two or three times each year. It is especially beneficial for Pitta types who are more
prone to eye complaints and is indicated for eyes that are frequently tired, hot, achy or gritty. Outside of this program,
the application of ghee to the eyes should not be practiced for more than two or three days consecutively, as this can
allow the eyes to become lazy and may prevent them from producing their own lubrication.
Instructions:
Melt a small amount of ghee in your palms and apply to eye area (with eyes closed). Open eyes slowly and blink a few
times so that ghee bathes the eyes.
Week one
Week two
Week three
Week four
Week five
Week six
Week seven

Practice every night before bed
Practice every other night before bed (ie; three times during week)
Practice every third night before bed (ie; twice during week)
Practice four days after last application
Practice five days after last application
Practice six days after last application
Practice seven days after last application

The idea is to gradually reduce the number of times each week that you practice this procedure. Thus, in the first week
you are placing ghee in the eyes every night and by week seven you are only placing ghee in the eyes once during the
week.

‘The Willis technique’
If your eyesight has become less focused when reading, or even if you use reading glasses for close up work, this simple
exercise will help retrain your eyes to relax and focus again.
Practice ‘palming’ (see eye exercises).
Open a book with relatively large print.
Slowly and easily (without straining to see individual words) scan the page.
After a while the odd word may jump out and be clearly visible.
At this stage stop scanning and read the page.
If you get a headache stop reading, close your eyes and practice palming for a couple of minutes and then try again.
Don’t worry if words don’t jump out at first, just persevere with this daily practice each day and eventually they will.
The key is patience and a relaxed mind.

105

Balancing the female cycle
Everyday women of all ages experience a need for relief from pre-menstrual, menstrual, pre-menopausal and
menopausal symptoms. Conditions such as mood swings, cramps, excessive bleeding, irregular cycles, hot flashes, and
seemingly insatiable cravings affect hundreds of thousands of women.
Ayurvedic therapy is not based purely on the removal of symptoms; rather, it empowers the body to heal itself. In this
regard treatment identifies and addresses the initial cause of PMS. The root cause of most cases of PMS begins early in
the lifestyle of a menstruating young woman.
Charaka and the other Ayurvedic authorities state that the suppression of natural urges, stress, excessive sex and
excessive physical exercise, along with an improper diet and lifestyle, are major contributors to the cause of female
reproductive disorders. There is a general consensus among Ayurvedic physicians as to why the excessive amount of
female disorders plague the West and not the East, and it has much to do with honouring the cycle itself. In India, the
menstrual cycle is a highly respected cycle that is an expression of the female connectedness to the cycles of the moon.
This lunar cycle regulates the tides, migrations, mating times and the twenty-eight day cycle of menstruation.
Menses is a time when the female body provides extra energy to insure an effective and complete flushing of waste
products. It is a natural time of cleansing and rejuvenation, traditionally accompanied by a time of rest or light duty. In
traditional cultures there were extended families that supported women during their monthly cycle and through
menstruation. Whilst, in the West, this is rarely the case it does not mean that the modern working women cannot
respect this time of the month by reducing stress and opting for a lighter work load. Ignoring this cycle is often at the
root of the premenstrual syndrome. If there is some desire to rest during menstruation and this is not provided, then
symptoms of some sort are sure to come about. Ayurvedic doctors generally recognise that the menstrual cycle and
monthly cleansing is one of the factors that lead to the generally longer life span of women compared to men.
The simple dietary and lifestyle adjustments recommended below can help offer relief from common premenstrual and
menstrual syndromes, and facilitate a smooth transition into menopause. A healthy cycle will also naturally enhance
fertility.
General recommendations:
•

Maintain a proper balance of rest and activity throughout the month. Rest during the period and practice
meditation, pranayama, yoga and exercise.

•

Take 2 tbsp of pure aloe vera juice after meals twice a day, but not during or within 3 days of the end of the
menstrual flow.

•

Perform a daily self-massage with warm sesame oil followed by a hot bath or shower. Pitta types should use
warm coconut oil followed by a warm shower.

•

Each day for seven days before the period begins do a self-massage, followed by a hot bath. Massage the
abdomen in a clockwise motion during the bath.

•

On the seventh day before your period, follow your self-massage and bath with laxative therapy: On an empty
stomach, take 30mls of castor oil mixed with ½ cup of apple or carrot juice. Do not eat until the majority of the
laxative action has occurred (3 to 5 hours). Usually, this procedure results in 2 to 5 bowel movements. You
may repeat this monthly for up to 6 months.

•

Eliminate caffeine as this can have a dramatic effect in women with fibrocystic breast disease.

•

Reduce or eliminate alcohol as this will reduce bloating and water retention in most women.

106

•

If you have pitta or kapha symptoms cut back on salt, sour foods and dairy products as this will also help
reduce bloating and water retention.

•

Eat stewed apples if you wish to relieve constipation.

•

Drink sweet ginger tea to help regulate disturbed or absent menses. Use raw honey or raw cane sugar.

•

Add saffron to meals to help regulate the menstrual cycle, relieve dysmenorrhoea and PMS, and promote
fertility. Saffron is also a digestive aid and also helps relieve respiratory congestion.

•

Herbs that are known to reduce symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome, infertility, menopause and
irregular or painful menstrual cycles include: Ashoka which is astringent, sedative, haemostatic, and it is
particularly good for those with an uncomfortably profuse menstrual flow; Shatavari which is a nutritive tonic
and anti-spasmodic – it also contains glucosides which are a food precursor of estrogen. It helps bring on
menses when one is experiencing amenorrhea (absence of periods); It is also commonly used for
dysmenorrhoea (painful periods); Punarnava which rejuvenates the endometrium and enhances the tone of the
uterus. It has been traditionally used for endometriosis and fibroid tumours.

Treatment of Vata Type PMS:
Symptoms of vata imbalance, as they manifest in relation to the menstrual cycle include: nervous tension, mood swings,
anxiety/depression; insomnia; forgetfulness/confusion; constipation; light amount of flow; menstrual
pain/cramps/backache; extended length of period with dark, clotted flow; irregularity of periods or flow.
•

Follow a Vata pacifying diet.

•

Chew fennel seeds after each meal to prevent gas and gallbladder congestion.

•

Drink fennel and licorice tea to help relieve PMS and regulate menstruation.

•

Take 1 tsp of castor oil every night for one month. Take less if there is a laxative effect.

•

If you usually have a light amount of flow; menstrual pain/cramps/backache; extended length of period with
dark, clotted flow; irregularity of periods or flow combine 2 parts shatavari, 2 parts musta, 1 part licorice, 1
part punarnava. Mix 1 tsp of this combination with sugar and ghee and take 3x a day.

•

If you often have nervous tension, mood swings, anxiety/depression, insomnia, forgetfulness/confusion, and/or
constipation, combine equal pts: brahmi, jatamamsi, ashwagandha, guduchi. Mix 1 tsp of this combination
with water and take 3x a day.

•

For pain experienced during the period, application of heat externally to the lower abdomen is advised. This
may be accomplished by massaging warm ripened sesame oil on the abdomen followed by the application of a
hot water bottle directly to the oiled skin.

Treatment of Pitta type PMS:
Symptoms of pitta imbalance, as they manifest in relation to the menstrual cycle include: irritability/anger; increased
appetite; headache (especially migraine); excessive body heat or sweating; diarrhoea or increased bowel movements;
skin rashes/acne; excessive menstrual bleeding; increased frequency of periods; bright red flow.
•

Follow a Pitta-pacifying diet.

•

Take 10mls ghee (clarified butter) with ten raisins daily.

•

Drink fennel and/or coriander tea during the day.

•

Take 2 parts shatavari, 1 part Ashoka, 1 part turmeric, 1 part brahmi. Take 1 tsp with water three times a day.

•

To decrease pitta and vata, take manjistha (1-2g) three times a day after meals.

107

•

Exercise moderately but avoid overheating.

•

Apply coconut oil to the head and feet at bedtime for more restful sleep and headache prevention.

•

Apply ghee to the nostrils for one week before the period.

•

Avoid overheating, hot water on the head, and over-exposure to sunlight.

•

When irritable or out of sorts it is important to ensure that you are getting adequate rest.

•

Be sure not to take long hot showers or hot baths during your heavy flow days as these tend to increase flow.
Take a short shower or sponge bath instead.

Treatment of Kapha type PMS:
Symptoms of Kapha imbalance as they manifest in relation to the menstrual cycle include: weight gain; fluid retention;
breast enlargement; abdominal bloating; acne; menstrual stiffness in back and joints; pale, mucousy menstrual flow.
•

Follow a Kapha-pacifying diet.

•

Avoid overeating, especially at night and do not eat when you are not hungry.

•

A primarily vegetarian diet is highly recommended.

•

Include ginger in your daily diet: take a pinch of fresh ginger root with a few drops of lemon juice before each
meal. Spice food with turmeric, ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon.

•

Take a herbal mixture of equal parts: shatavari, ashwagandha, trikatu. Mix with honey into a paste and take 1
tsp three times a day. Also take 1 tsp Dashmula in 2 cups water and boil down to ½ cup; drink ½ cup two times
a day. Dashmula is a Ayurvedic formula containing ten roots.

•

If you are prone to sluggishness, prepare a calamus nasya: combine ½ teaspoon calamus with 1 ounce sesame
oil. Place 10-15 drops into each nostril, three times a day.

•

It is especially important to get daily exercise. A brisk walk for 30 minutes is the minimum exercise required.
Perform deep nasal breathing during exercise.

•

Do not sleep during the day unless illness or unusual circumstances cause exhaustion. Always try to avoid
sleeping within 2 hours after a meal.

How to keep your joints healthy
To understand how to maintain proper health and function of the joints, we first need to look at their anatomy and
physiology. Joints hold the bones together and are designed to provide movement within the skeletal system. The main
function of bone is support, while the joints allow a certain amount of flexibility and to our structure. The synovial
joints, where the ends of bone are connected by a joint cavity or capsule containing synovial fluid, allow freedom and
fluidity in the articulation of our movements.
The supportive tissues; ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue, are kapha dosha, while the joint cavity or space where
the bones meet is an element ruled by vata dosha. The joint capsule provides a container for the slippery synovial fluid,
again a kapha substance that lubricates the ends of the bone surfaces and also accommodates a tough, protective
covering into which the ligaments and tendons can insert themselves. It is through the ligaments that nerve impulses are
transmitted to the muscles signalling movement, a function of vata dosha.
Healthy joint tissue and function are crucial to how we move and express ourselves through our bodies. According to
ayurveda, vitiated or disturbed vata dosha can create imbalance within the joints resulting in pain and discomfort. Most
commonly affected joints are knees, ankles, elbows, wrists, fingers and toes. When there is an imbalance in the joints, it
is important to discern whether or not the imbalance exists with or without ama, a sticky toxic substance. A simple test
can be done with organic sesame oil. Massage the oil into the joint. If the symptoms are aggravated, then there is ama
present, a condition known as amavata. If the symptoms are alleviated by the oil massage, or stay the same, then the
treatment will begin with the removal of the causative factors and balancing vata dosha.
The dryness of vata can deplete the lubricating qualities of kapha and joint surfaces can become rough and brittle.
Common symptoms of vata imbalance in the joints are dryness, popping and cracking, and muscle tics and spasms.
Some common causative factors are jogging, jumping, excessive exercise, injury, consuming too many dry foods, living
in a cold, dry climate and irregular eating habits and lifestyle. Entering the vata season of life of fifty years and older
will also increase vata dosha throughout the body. Particularly during the vata season of autumn and winter, when the
temperature becomes cold and the wind begins to blow, symptoms may become aggravated. Ayurveda offers simple
guidelines and herbal remedies for supporting healthy function of the joints.
A few lifestyle therapies for balancing excess vata in the joints are:
•

Maintain a regular schedule, sleeping and waking at the same time each day.

•

Abhyanga, self-oil massage every evening. Choose organic sesame or vata massage oil.

•

Massage medicinal Mahanarayan oil locally into sore, stiff joints.

•

Follow vata pacifying diet, taking meals at regular times each day.

•

Practice gentle yoga.

In a condition of amavata, ama is carried by misdirected or vitiated vata into general circulation throughout the body.
When it interacts with the kapha in the joint spaces, the synovial fluid loses its' highly viscous quality and changes into
a sticky toxic substance. It can begin to block vital channels throughout the body that carry nutrients to the tissues and
cause dysfunction within the joint. The immune system can begin to attack the ama stored in the joints causing an
inflammation of the joint lining. Inflamed tissue can result in symptoms of excess heat, redness, pain, stiffness, and
swelling. Acute inflammation, if left untreated, can cause damage or injury to the joint and bone tissue resulting in a
chronic condition. Untreated chronic inflammation can lead to degenerative disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Ama
can be clotted together with dead cells which the immune system sweeps up. Because it can also be so deeply embedded
within healthy tissue, the immune cells can become confused by the similarity to that which it has been scavenging,
unable to properly identify the toxic invader from the healthy tissue; an "autoimmune" reaction.
The primary causes for accumulation of ama are improper diet, excessive exercise, exhaustion due to overwork,
extreme worry, and the use of alcohol. It commonly occurs in cold, damp climates. For the condition of amavata,
removing the causative factors and eliminating ama from the body are paramount. Treatment to balance the doshas and
rejuvenate the joint and bone tissue ensues.

109

Here are some additional lifestyle guidelines to help reduce ama and restore balance:
•

Favour warm, nourishing, easy to digest meals such as Kichari (rice and lentil soup).

•

Include ghee or flax seed oil in your diet as both are nourishing and anti-inflammatory.

•

Avoid white sugar and alcohol.

•

Use unprocessed, raw honey (uncooked) to help gently scrape away ama.

•

Avoid dairy, particularly ice cream and cheese.

•

Apply castor oil to sore joints and then apply a heating pad to help reduce inflammation and scrape ama.

•

Keep the colon clean and empty bowels regularly each day.

•

Sip hot water and tea made from dry ginger root (or ginger tea bags).

•

Practice deep, abdominal breathing exercises (pranayama) to gently help to move toxins from the body.

•

Meditate daily for clarity.

•

Address any psychological disturbances or unresolved emotions.

Herbs traditionally used to help increase the body’s digestive fire and enable cleansing and expulsion of ama, while
reducing inflammation and rejuvenating the joints include:
•

Guggulu – an anti-inflammatory with strong purifying and rejuvenating properties. Indicated for arthritis,
rheumatism, gout, lumbago, disorders of the nervous, respiratory, digestive and circulatory systems.

•

Guduchi - a broad spectrum pitta-reducing herb that destroys toxins and strengthens immunity.

•

Triphala - Amalaki, Bibhitaki, and Haritaki - the three fruits for detoxifying and tonifying the body.

•

Vidanga - a powerful herb which destroys ama (toxins).

•

Ashwagandha - an adaptogenic rejuvenative herb with anti-inflammatory properties.

•

Gokshura - an anti-inflammatory and rejuvenative.

•

Turmeric - an anti-bacterial and powerful blood purifier with anti-inflammatory properties.

•

Trikatu (ginger, black pepper and pippali) – a powerful digestive aids that increases agni (digestive fire), helps
burn ama and promotes circulation.

How to cope with allergies
Allergies, whether from food, pollen, dust, mould, or dander, are typically a form of hypersensitivity reaction. The
underlying causes of allergic symptoms are rarely from the allergens themselves, making proper Ayurvedic diagnosis
essential. A main causative factor of allergies is a by-product of improperly digested food. This toxic substance, called
ama, is manufactured in the digestive system and is absorbed into the circulatory system. Once systemic, ama can block
and clog the channels of circulation.
The removal of ama in the circulatory system will often play a primary role in the management of immediate allergic
hypersensitivity. Depending on body type, the underlying cause of allergic hypersensitivities will vary. It should be
understood that mental and emotional stresses are also common contributing factors in a hypersensitive allergic
response.
Ayurveda compares the body to a field and allergens to seeds; if the land is not fertile, then any seeds that are sown will
not sprout. The fertilizer is a toxic residue called ama - a sticky substance formed in the digestive system from food that
has been incompletely processed. It lowers natural immunity and increases receptivity to allergens. This toxic byproduct migrates to the body’s points of weakness, creating a vicious cycle by lowering resistance even more.
Allergies to pollen and other plant materials also involve an imbalance of the Kapha dosha, which controls the lungs,
sinuses, and fluid balance in the body. When Kapha is out of balance, exposure to allergens stimulates symptoms like
watery eyes, sneezing, coughing and fatigue.
Kapha’s strongest influence is during peak allergy season, March-June. The presence of ama can weaken the thymus
gland or spleen; both of which contribute to the body's immune system and trigger allergic reactions. However, eating
more of certain foods and herbs can help remove ama, bring balance to Kapha, and thus hold allergies at bay.
The first step is to minimize chilled foods and high-fat dishes (such as cheese, yogurt and meat) and replace them with
warm, freshly cooked foods, including plenty of asparagus and broccoli, both of which support the immune system.
Then integrate the herbs turmeric and tulsi (or holy basil) into your diet.
Turmeric activates the liver and strengthens the blood to help remove ama, and research shows that turmeric's active
ingredient, curcumin, has an anti-allergic effect. You can sprinkle a mixture of ground turmeric, cumin, coriander, bay
leaf, and cinnamon in your food. You can also bring a cup of milk to the boil, remove it from the heat, add a bay leaf
and a pinch each of turmeric and cinnamon and then drink it warm.
Holy basil strengthens the immune system, reduces ama, and helps remove environmental pollution from the body. For
an effective anti-allergy tea, bring a pint of water to a boil, remove from the heat, and for five minutes steep five holy
basil leaves, two pinches licorice, one bay leaf, a pinch of cinnamon, and a pinch of cardamom.

Waking up with the sun

If you are suffering from rhinitis or excess dryness, this is a Vata cause and would most likely respond well to the Vata
treatments. If you are suffering from sinusitis, internal heat, or excessive irritability or anger, you may benefit from
using the Pitta treatments. If you are suffering from congestion or fatigue, the best option may be to select Kapha
treatments.
Vata causes: The vata body type is susceptible to various hypersensitivity reactions. In the case of allergic rhinitis, a
vata imbalance will cause excessive dryness in the body. When this dryness finds its way to the respiratory system and
sinuses, the protective mucous lining will dry up. This natural protection acts as a filter, temperature buffer, and first

111

line of allergic immunity. When this layer of mucous dries up, the airborne allergens of dust, pollen, and pollution act as
irritants in the sinuses, evoking an immediate hypersensitivity response. The body’s natural response to these irritants is
to lay down mucous as a means of protection. The dryness alone will also trigger the body to produce mucous, making
allergic symptoms a common vata condition. In this instance, allergic symptoms can be chronic and constant due to a
deep mucosal dryness rather than a particular allergen. The vata body type is also particularly sensitive to lifestyle and
daily routine. Most importantly with regard to allergens, the vata type must take the proper time to eat a large lunch in a
relaxed atmosphere without the distractions of television, magazines, or phone calls. Such distractions aggravate the
vata aspects of digestion, producing ama and hypersensitivity reactions.
Vata treatments:
•

Nasya: sniff sesame oil deeply into both nostrils two to three times a day

•

Triphala: take ½ teaspoon per day on an empty stomach

•

Ginger root tea: take three to four cups per day; also; also chew small pieces as a lozenge

Pitta causes: The pitta type will be subject to an accumulation of heat in the body and blood. The heat is produced as a
result of a physiological hyper-metabolic state needed to burn off the excess ama in the blood. This heat, as does all
heat, will rise up in the body into the head and neck. When this heat rises up into the sinuses, the effect is one of dryness
along with the accumulation of impurities (ama) in the blood. The result of the dryness aggravates vata as we mentioned
previously, and the excess blood ama aggravates pitta. The sinuses respond by acting as organs of excretion rather than
secretion producing an allergic response. The treatment for pitta-based allergic response is twofold. The blood must be
purified with pitta-pacifying herbs and the dryness must be dealt with, as in the case of vata.
Pitta treatments:
•

Take ½ teaspoon of cumin seed as a lozenge during the day

•

Triphala: take ½ teaspoon twice a day on an empty stomach

•

Nasya: sniff coconut oil deeply into both nostrils two to three times a day

•

Turmeric powder: take ½ teaspoon with ¼ cup warm milk, three times a day after meals

•

Neem leaf tea: drink 3-4 cups per day as a detoxifier

Kapha causes: The kapha body type is classically the most susceptible to allergies and kapha imbalances and is often
mislabeled the causative factor in most allergic conditions. It is the nature of kapha to produce and hold onto more
water, congestion and ama however, and the treatment of kapha in all allergies is a common mistake. The symptoms of
most allergic responses are kapha in nature with the production of congestion, fatigue, and malaise; but the CAUSE of
these kapha symptoms may be vata, pitta, or kapha. This diagnosis is crucial. It is, however, very common for the cause
and symptoms of an allergic response to be kapha in nature. In this regard, the treatment is straightforward with the
focus on pacifying kapha with bitter, astringent, and pungent herbs and spices, in order to remove excess mucous.
Allergy treatments can become more complicated when multiple causes are present. Imbalances in vata and kapha, for
example, can easily create chronic allergic symptoms. Treatment for each are opposite in nature, and care must be given
to balance both kapha and vata at the same time.
Kapha treatments:
•

Trikatu: take ¼ teaspoon with raw honey before each meal

•

Sitopladi: take ½ teaspoon with raw honey three times a day on an empty stomach

•

Licorice: take ½ teaspoon with warm water after meals

•

Maintain a liquid diet one day per week, as ama-reducing therapy. This diet generally consists of eating
vegetables and fruits which have been put through a blender and liquefied. Meals can be taken at room
temperature, warm or hot. The liquid diet is normally part of an Ayurvedic cleansing program; putting foods
through a blender prior to ingestion puts less strain on the digestive system.

Stress free vacations
(a few tips to help you enjoy holiday travel)

•

Plan well ahead to avoid panicking and rushing about arranging last minute details.

•

Consciously make an effort to enjoy the journey to your chosen destination and take pride in the preparations –
preparations are a chance to find out about new places and new ways to travel while delays during travel are
opportunities to meet new people and catch up on some reading.

•

Leave yourself time to wind down from work before you go away – take time to pack and relax for a few days
before you depart.

•

Once you leave work, put the phone on answer, delegate and trust other people to make decisions and advance
things on your behalf and, above all, don’t be tempted to phone in to check on how things are going. Tell work
colleagues not to ring you at home or on holiday – it’s your rest and re-cooperation time.

•

Make sure you’ve got enough foreign currency – get it before you go to avoid rushing about at the airport or trying
to find somewhere to exchange money at your destination. Have your money, credit cards, passport, travel ticket,
accommodation details and other crucial paperwork and telephone numbers somewhere together where you won’t
forget them.

•

Rest, relax, exercise, eat healthily and meditate regularly during the week before you go away. You’ll be able to
settle into the vacation and enjoy it all the more if you’re already rested and fully prepared before you go.

•

Make sure your diet is as healthy as possible in the weeks before you go away – this ensures maximum immunity,
settled digestion and loads of energy and vitality stored up to allow your holiday to be fully enjoyed. The most
important thing is to avoid any processed or refined foods (very few nutrients and lots of toxins for the body to deal
with). Avoid refined sugar (in most processed/refined/packaged foods), reduce salt (except Vata types), avoid
white/brown bread and white pasta/rice (except basmati), avoid margarine (stick to butter, ghee or olive oil) and cut
down on red meat and cold milk.

•

Favour organic produce for maximum nutrition and energy (you’ll eat less and they’ll be more tasty). Favour fresh
fruit and vegetables, whole grains (rice, buckwheat, barley, millet, quinoa etc), homemade fruit/veg juices and
small tasty salads. Reduce tea/coffee and alcohol and favour herbal teas and hot water with lemon or ginger.

•

Maximize the use of ‘superfoods’ such as wheatgrass (fresh or powdered), spiralina, chlorella, kelp, milk thistle,
ginseng, ground sunflower/ pumpkin/linseed and almonds.

•

Set off for the airport with loads of time to spare. Take plenty of reading material to occupy your time if you are
delayed in airports etc. Enjoy the delays and don’t get angry or frustrated – use the time to your benefit – read,
talk, eat early etc.

•

Once on holiday drink plenty of water (not ice-cold as this destroys your power of digestion and can lead to
stomach upsets). Eat only when hungry and avoid eating past the feeling of comfort – put less on your plate and
wait five minutes before taking seconds – usually you don’t need any after that.

•

Pitta types should avoid too much sun and keep cool – plenty of water and a good sun cream. Coconut oil or
ghee/aloe vera with lavender oil helps soothe and re-moisturise the skin.

113

Chapter 6

Balancing the mind & emotions
~ for peace and happiness & a calm and contented mind ~

“Life without goodness; good thoughts, good actions and good words
is like the sky in the night without the moon or stars.
It is like a wheel without a hub or spokes.
No one can push a boulder away while standing on it
- no one can be free from anxiety while all the entrances
through which it sneaks in are open.”
~ Atharva Veda ~

How to be happy & peaceful!
The ancient Vedic texts of Indian philosophy abound with prescriptions for lasting peace and happiness. The pages that
follow synthesis a little of their teachings.
•

Past experiences, good or bad, are our greatest teachers; in fact they are our only teachers. Brooding over past
events and worrying about the future fills our minds with toxic waste; it is a useless pastime and drains our
mental power. How we develop and refine our mind determines our success, fulfilment and happiness in life.

•

During every waking moment we have a choice; either stand back and quietly contemplate how to react
appropriately to any given situation or to allow our lower instincts; our robotic, mechanistic instincts, to take
over, without any thought or concern for the consequences of our actions. We always have the power to
determine which attitude to adopt – we can either look at any negative or stressful situation as a crisis, a
nightmare, a seemingly insurmountable problem or as simply an opportunity to learn and grow; it all depends
on our chosen interpretation of the situation.

•

We all have the capacity to allow ourselves to see the cup as half full or half empty – it is simply our response
to events and situations that determines which it is to be. If we have the resourcefulness to cultivate inward
calm, by controlling our negative thought patterns, the outer world responds accordingly. All that is required to
create a peaceful, harmonious outer experience is a bed-rock of inner peace and calm.

•

There are no mistakes or truly negative experiences in the relative world; it is just as it should be. To savour
the very best of life we must have savoured it’s opposite to know it for what it is. How can we truly experience
pure joy and exuberance unless we know and have experienced its exact opposite?

•

Once we stop judging people, situations and circumstances as good or bad, positive or negative, we can simply
and passively experience them, learn from them, grow through them and become stronger, mentally and
physically.

•

We need to remember that more often than not as one door closes another one opens. Without closing the first
door the other is unable to open – it is the letting go that enables the other to begin to manifest. If we wish to
create a new reality we must first create new thoughts, for the foundation of our relative experience begins in
the mind. It is our ideas about something that causes the outer reality and not the other way round.

•

The trick is to imagine, as vividly as possible, the outer experience or event we would like to create and then to
allow the universe to take care of the details. If we cultivate an attitude of total expectancy, and allow dormant
forces of true knowledge to awaken within us, we will be ready to clearly perceive the opportunities that
present themselves. We will be able to react appropriately and decisively to them and thus ensure their positive
outcome. We must consciously and perpetually replace all negative thoughts with positive and uplifting
thoughts. We must remember that if we are able to allow negative thoughts to dominate our thinking we can
also allow ourselves to be dominated by positive thoughts; it is our divine birthright.

•

A weak mind leads to weak thoughts and actions. However, a strong and positive mind ensures success in the
outer world and becomes a true measure of our success in cultivating inner peace and harmony. Everything in
life is first created first in the mind and then in our outer reality. If we take responsibility for our own thoughts,
turning negative into positive, the world around us responds in a positive way. Inner peace and happiness is
always rewarded with a delightful outer experience. It is never the other way round.

•

The richness and quality of life is a reflection of the richness and quality of our thoughts so if we truly wish to
have a wonderful and meaningful life on this planet we need to ensure we cultivate peaceful, meaningful
thoughts. If we patiently expect a positive outcome we will surely receive it but only if we prepare our mind

116

first. We must believe that if we can think or dream of anything at all it is because we truly have the capacity
to realise it on an outward level.
•

Our minds have immeasurable power and can literally materialize anything we desire so long as we remain
patiently focused on what it is we wish to have. Thus, we need to discover, through relaxed contemplation,
what it is we truly want from our lives and then we must direct all of our attention towards it. If we can direct
our intention and attention to our innermost desires, in a relaxed and concentrated manner, they will begin to
manifest with ease.

•

If we delay the process of cultivating our minds because we’re too busy pursuing other goals we’re never
going to achieve true peace and happiness. If we have a leaky pipe in our home and we delay fixing it, the
house may eventually flood and the small problem becomes a hundred times worse. Or, if we do not take the
time to backup our computer files each week, we may eventually lose them all and have to start from scratch
when it crashes due to a virus or hardware malfunction. Similarly, each day we delay refining our minds and
pursuing our innermost desires, we push our peace and happiness further and further away.

•

Tiredness and lack of motivation also result when we fail to follow our inner dreams and desires. Once we are
living and following our greatest dreams fatigue becomes a thing of the past, for every action then becomes a
source of fulfilment and joy. This brings sharpness, clarity and motivation to our lives. Tiredness is our support
for showing us what is not meant to be done by us, whilst energy and motivation shows us where we are
ultimately meant to direct our energies for lasting success and happiness.

•

If we become accustomed to leading perpetually hectic, frantic lives we miss out on the pure joy of living and
eventually become uncomfortable in peaceful, harmonious surroundings and being with relaxed, happy people.
More disturbing still is the fact that we also become uncomfortable when our own minds transcend towards
peace and stillness. True peace and stillness becomes foreign to us and we consciously or unconsciously try to
avoid it. If we do not learn to control our mind at the earliest opportunity it begins to control us and we become
a slave to its unruly, desire-ridden nature. If we cultivate inner silence and stillness, in mind and body, we will
see it reflected in our outward life; we will begin to notice it in our surroundings and the people we meet each
and every day.

•

The way we see and believe life will unfold, is the way it will unfold for us, so we must practice the art of
‘seeing in our minds eye’ the way we wish to have these situations and events unfold. If we cannot see the
target we will never be able to hit it; we need to form a clear mental image of the outcome and the clearer the
mental image the more effective will be the outcome. By seeing the outcome in the present, rather than in the
dim and distant future, allows the results to come more quickly; imagine the success you desire has already
occurred and that you are already reaping the rewards. Also, by writing down our goals we bring them to life
simply through the act of committing them to paper. This act allows clarity of purpose and we then begin to
consciously and subconsciously notice or seek out opportunities that allow them to develop. We must not let
doubts or negative thoughts get in the way – we must get into the habit of replacing them with more positive
thoughts the moment they arise. If we ponder on negative situations for long enough we allow them to start
manifesting –as we have begin the process of creating them.

•

One way of speeding along the process of achieving our dreams and desires is to help others achieve theirs.
The more we are in the field of success and achievement the more its energy is drawn to us and the faster our
dreams can manifest into reality. By acknowledging another’s purpose in life we also acknowledge our own. A
life without purpose ceases to have any meaning and eventually withers away but a life lived with purpose
grows and evolves in leaps and bounds. If we confidently work towards our goals and ambitions and aspire to
do only things we really love to do, we will achieve lasting peace and happiness.

•

The key to a joyous and happy life is to quietly contemplate our dharma or ‘life-purpose’ and, having
discovered where our heart lies, applying our unique skills and talents towards achieving our purpose. We

117

must let go of any disappointments or setbacks along the way and rejoice in every tiny success we achieve.
Therein we find the objective of life itself and begin to experience profound fulfilment and happiness.
•

There are no limits in life other than the ones we set our self. We can change negative thought patterns and bad
habits in an instant if we so desire. As long as we consciously direct our energy and motivation towards the
goal we have set ourselves we can easily replace any negative thoughts and bad habits for with more lifesustaining ones. However, we should never do anything just because we have to; we should act from our sense
of knowingness and righteousness. If it is the right thing to do we should do it without any hesitation
whatsoever, acting from our divine intuition; our heart centre.

•

There is no situation that is inherently painful or pleasant outside of our perception of it. They are both
conditioned responses based on past experiences. When we begin to realise this we move into a new arena of
life; an arena of choice. Just because we experienced something a certain way in the past does not mean it will
occur in exactly the same way again. If we react to a given situation with anger or fear it is because we are
basing our reasoning on past experiences; and past events do not usually pan out exactly the same way twice.
In this circumstance we suffer from false thinking and act from a position of ignorance; we fall prey to a
conditioned response. We should aim to cultivate an attitude of non-attachment towards outer events and
thereby prevent ourselves falling into the trap of fear and ignorance.

•

Rest, play and relaxation are as important to a successful and fulfilling life as anything we can ever do or say.
The amount of success we achieve in outer lives is in direct proportion to the level of peace and contentment
we cultivate in our hearts and minds. Without lightness of spirit, love of life, appreciation of silence and mental
clarity all our actions become ineffective and energy-depleting. The healthier our physical body and the more
our minds are rested, the more strength and energy we have to direct into the outer world.

•

If we don’t recognize the value of rest, relaxation, meditation and prayer we cannot hope to achieve anything
of any significance in our outer world. We may achieve great power and riches but it will have been at the cost
of our inner strength, peace of mind and happiness. We must therefore take great care of our inner core; the
bedrock of our existence, so that we have great strength and resilience to direct our energy into the world
around us. A man who is rested and relaxed can direct twice as much energy to his home and work
environment, and can therefore achieve success in half the time and with half the energy it takes a man who is
frantically busy and stressed all day long.

•

Everything in our relative world must have its equal and opposite and this is no different when it comes to our
minds. The deeper the mind is able to dive into silence on a regular basis, the higher, and faster and longer our
mental faculties work. There are many ways of doing this including gentle exercise, yoga, breath awareness,
dance, music, prayer, solitude and walking in nature on a daily basis. However, the most powerful way to still
the mind and release energy is meditation, which should be practiced for at least twenty minutes twice a day to
be most effective.

•

For the mind to be stilled easily the body needs to be healthy and this means good, wholesome fuel in terms of
food and drink. The more fresh and natural our food the more energy our body has at its disposal; we are no
more than the fuel (food) we put into ourselves. If our food is poor, our body and mind are weak. If our mind
and body are weak our thoughts are also weak. If our thoughts are weak our choices become poor, weak and
confused. Weak choices lead to poor decisions and consequently to poor, ineffective actions. Poor, ineffective
actions do not achieve success and we end up tired, stressed, unfulfilled and unhappy. Therefore, the
foundation of our existence is the food we choose to eat and the lifestyle we chose to lead. The choices we
make in this area ultimately determine our success or failure in life.

•

If we choose to eat meat we dull our mind, as meat is a heavy food and hard for the body to digest. The
digestive system uses most energy, and if it has to digest heavy foods, it leaves very little energy for our
mental faculties. It also builds up heat in the mind and body, leading to anger and violence and also to
inflammatory conditions such as gout and arthritis. However, eating fresh organic fruit, vegetables grains and

118

pulses create energy, ojas and vitality – these types of food increase our prana or life energy and help us ward
of stress. Old age and disease.
•

Simply by allowing time to reflect on our lives, and contemplating where it may be improved, is to start a
process whereby we may begin to discover joy in our lives again. The only way to improve our lives is to be
able to notice and acknowledge what we did wrong yesterday and then to make a commitment not to fall into
the same trap twice. As we continue with this process our judgment becomes refined and our lives become
more successful.

•

As we begin to make positive changes we should remain alert to the consequences of these changes so that we
know we’re on the right track. We may perhaps notice that on the days when we go to bed early, and
consequently arise much earlier in the morning, we have more energy and are happier throughout the day. We
may also notice that when we go to bed earlier we actually need less sleep. We may perhaps notice that when
we take the time to stroll in the countryside we feel much better, and are more caring and friendly to those
around us. We may also notice that when we are able to get some rays of sunshine on our skin each day, our
bodies feel healthier and more alive. We may notice we have more energy and the mind feels sharper when we
don’t eat meat, or that when we have a light meal in the evening we sleep better and wake more refreshed.
Perhaps we notice that a little laughter each morning, or playing with our children, releases ‘feel-good’
hormones in the mind and body and then allows us greater clarity and enjoyment of the rest of the day.

•

As we begin to notice that as we change our thought patterns our outlook on life becomes positive and our selfimage improves. As we clear away the clutter from the mind we uncover the true meaning of our lives and
begin to prioritise those things that matter and reprioritise those things that don’t. Life slowly begins to become
more peaceful, less stressed and more fulfilling.

As we begin this process of renewal and rejuvenation of the mind our fear of failure also becomes less and less
and stops draining our energy. Indeed, we finally realise that there is no real failure in life, only opportunities
to learn and grow and become stronger in the process. As our energy increases, our willpower also increases,
and we begin to find we are falling off the path of happiness and contentment less often. We may also find that
we are more able to cope with the consequences when we do. This knowledge and strength gives us a great
sense of freedom and feelings of inner power that allows us to stick to our new way of being more easily.

•

As we begin to be more self-referral and less ego based we become more self-controlled and more able to hold
back when a situation demands it. A once angry response to a situation now becomes calmer and allows for
more constructive ideas on how to resolve the particular situation. As we begin to achieve small victories over
our restless minds we allow larger victories to be achieved in our outer world. We begin to understand that
ninety-nine percent of our success comes from using just one percent of our minds capacity and that ninetynine percent of our thought is pure junk anyway and serves only to interfere with the truth of any given
situation.

•

If we can learn to laugh at our ourselves every once in a while, and not take life so seriously, we begin to
notice that we are already surrounded by beauty and joy, and that our searching for happiness in the outer
world was in vain; it was right here in front of us all the while. As we begin to see the world in a different light
and start to pay less attention to our doubts and fears we realise that failure is impossible. As long as we work
steadily and consciously towards achieving our objectives, success is assured and our desires are fulfilled.

•

However, our happiness is just the journey on which we travel through life; it is not the final destination. When
we allow ourselves to stop and savour each and every moment, pure joy becomes our everlasting reality. When
we stop chasing the desire for success and achievement in the outer world we begin to find it is already present
in our quiet inner world. As we start to live more and more in the present moment we realise that happiness
and joy were always with us. We then become a source of pleasure and joy to ourselves and to those around us.

Key points for cultivating mental peace
•

Remember to gently turn your mind away from negative/stressful thoughts and to place your attention on the area
of the body where this negativity appears to be felt. Rest your attention on this area for a while, breathe into it and
as the feeling fades, turn the mind to healthier, happier thoughts.

•

Remember that fear, worry and anxiety are the largest drain on the body’s energy levels and a major cause of
illness and disease.

•

Try to live in the present; enjoying and savouring each precious moment. Regret, or reminiscence of past events.
drain your energy and hinder your enjoyment and appreciation of the present. Accept what has been, what is and
what may be, and enjoy each moment - for it comes only once.

•

Trust in nature and have faith that the future will work out fine when unhindered by stress and negative thought
patterns.

•

Use positive language in verbal and mental communication with yourself and others. Try not to use words such as,
I can’t, I should and I need and replace them with words such as; I can, I will, I must or I choose. These words
have more power of conviction and are more likely to be acted upon

•

Boost your confidence, self-worth and self-esteem by listing all the things you like about yourself, the things that
make you unique and all the things you are good at.

•

Remember that it is only through self-confidence, happiness and inner harmony that you may pass joy and
happiness to those around you. Love and peace can only spread through the world, affecting each and every living
thing when we are happy and loving within ourselves.

•

Help yourself to help others by radiating love, peace, honesty, understanding and calmness. Notice the beauty and
gentle sounds of nature and spend time appreciating the rising or setting sun.

•

Be non-judgemental and graciously accept the way things are. Remind yourself often for it is the only way to truly
begin to learn how to change oneself. Practice acceptance and silently allow life to unfold naturally and
effortlessly, accepting things as they are and not as you wish they were.

•

Learn to trust and act on your intuition, trying not to let the mind hinder your self-referral process with fear, doubt
or anxiety. Casually witness the choices you make each day and ask yourself what the consequences of making
this or that particular choice might be. Will acting on the choice you make bring fulfilment and happiness towards
yourself and those affected by making that choice?

•

Having now begun to accept the challenges life throws your way and also having begun to trust and act upon your
intuition in response to them, it’s now time to also take responsibility for your actions. This means not blaming
anyone or anything for the situations you find yourself in and realising that each and every situation presented is an
opportunity in disguise. It is an opportunity to observe, listen and learn and transform it into a great benefit.

•

Relinquish the need to defend a point of view. Try not to feel the need to convince or persuade others to accept
your point of view or to be rigidly attached to it. This way, the mind is flexible and free. It is able to move on,
progress and learn.

120

Resolving inner conflict & limiting beliefs
‘The Enquiry’
Here are a series of questions that you can ask yourself to enable you to delve into the heart of any issue or problem that
is troubling you. By thinking of the issue you would like to resolve and then asking yourself these questions the inner
reality of the situation is often revealed. It is important to be really honest with yourself and to listen to your intuition.
Ignore your intellectual mind and listen to your quiet, inner voice that would truthfully like to dissolve the particular
issue in question, forever.
First think of the particular situation, person, issue or problem that troubles you most at this present moment. Now
create a statement regarding this situation, person, issue or problem that you think you have. Make the statement as
clear as possible eg: my boss makes my job very stressful; my son shouldn’t play on the computer so much; my partner
should help me around the house more often; my mother should be more understanding; if I had more money my life
would be happier.
For each statement you come up with, ask yourself:
•
•
•
•
•

Is it true?
Can I absolutely know that my statement or thought is true?
How do I react when I think this particular thought?
Who would I be without this thought?
What would I be like without this thought?

Do not judge each answer too deeply; just be open-minded and relaxed and see what answer spontaneously appears. Try
not to be too intellectual or rational and listen to your heart rather than your intellect. See what you really think and not
what you may ‘think you should think’ or what others may ‘think you should think’.
•

Now see if you can change the original statement round so it applies to yourself rather than the other person. If
your statement was ‘my son should not play on the computer so much’ turn it round to say ‘I should not be on
the computer so much’ or ‘I should not watch television so much’.

Ask yourself if this reversed statement is true or has any relevance on some level if you are very honest with yourself?’
•

Now turn the original statement round to it’s opposite and then apply it to yourself. You might now have ‘ I
should be on the computer as often as I am’ or ‘I should be watching television as often as I do’.

Ask yourself if this opposite statement could perhaps be true, especially at the present time?’
•

Now apply this new (opposite) statement to the other person or situation. For instance the statement may now
say ‘my son should be watching television so much’ or ‘my son does need to play computer games so often (he
needs to distract himself from the fact his best friend has just been badly hurt in a traffic accident)’.

Ask yourself if this new (opposite) statement could perhaps be true on some level?’
Below is a slightly expanded version of the above and may help you go deeper into the absolute reality of the statements
you create. Just ask yourself these questions and wait to see if a little clarity and understanding begins to dawn in your
awareness.
Create your statement and ask yourself:
•
•
•
•

Is it true?
What’s the underlying reality of it? (Does it really happen? Does he/she really do that? Am I really like that?
Do I really do that?)
Whose business it is anyway? (Is not my business only my business and not his/her business? Is his/her
business only his/her business and not mine?)
Can I absolutely know that this statement is true? (What if I am wrong? Could I possibly be wrong in my
judgment of this situation/issue?)

121

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

What are the consequences of my statement?
What are the consequences of my interpretation of the situation/issue?
What does my statement mean for me and for the other person? Am I a better person or a worse person for it?
Are they a better person or a worse person for it?
What do I think I would have if things were the way I think they should be?
What’s the worst that could happen if my statement is really true?
What’s the “should”? (if there’s no should in the original statement then put one in). Where’s the proof that
this should be so? Where’s the proof that things ‘should’ be any different than what they already are?
What have I to learn from this situation?
Will I be a better person or a stronger person from having learnt from this situation?
Am I going to live life more fully in the future from having resolved this issue?
Will I be happier if I drop this thought?

Consider for a moment how you react when you think (or believe) the original statement? How much of your life is
based upon it? What do you do and what do you say when you do and say you believe it?
Now ask yourself:
•
•
•

Can I see a reason to drop this thought?
Can I find one stress-free reason to keep this though?
Who would I be without that thought? How would I be without that thought?

Now turn around the original statement. Here is an example: “Paul should appreciate me”.
If you turn it around to yourself it becomes: “I should appreciate myself” (it’s my job, not his).
Turning it around to the other person it becomes: “I should appreciate Paul” (especially when he doesn’t appreciate me).
If you turn it around to the opposite it becomes: “Paul shouldn’t appreciate me (unless he does)”.
Now consider each of the questions below and work through ‘the enquiry’ again (if necessary) for each individual
person. By slightly altering these questions they can also be applied to other issues or situations.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Who angers or saddens or disappoints me?
What is it about them that I didn’t or still don’t like?
How do I want them to change?
Why do I want them to change?
What do I want them to do?
Why do I want them to do this?
Do I need anything from them?
Why do I need anything from them?
What do they need to give me in order for me to be happy?
What do they need to do in order for me to be happy?
What do I think of them?
Why do I think of them in this way?
What is it that I don’t ever want to experience with that person, thing or situation again?

By simple asking yourself these questions you begin to look at your circumstances and situations in a different light.
The trick is to ask yourself these questions in a relaxed, non-judgmental way and then to notice the answers coming to
you without much prompting. Be as light as possible and consider the ways in which the initial answers could be
reversed or turned around. Try and allow your more intuitive or sub-conscious mind to answer for you and just
innocently ‘watch’ the answers appearing. Ask yourself these questions whenever negative thoughts arise about any
situation, circumstance or issue. You’ll soon find that you are able to stand back and witness these thoughts popping up
in your awareness and be able to let them go as quickly as they fleetingly appeared in the first place.

If you are interested in this line of enquiry we strongly recommend reading the book on which this material is based:
‘Loving What Is’ by Byron Katie.

Thought Field Therapy (Tft)
Thought Field Therapy is a simple technique which involves tapping or pressing on energy points (marmas) to rapidly
remove phobias, traumas, anxiety and depression. This miraculous phenomenon can seem bewildering to the patient
who has often undergone months and sometimes years of physiological counselling to control the problem; and often to
little or no avail. The technique has been developed and refined over the past twenty-five years through the dedication
and perseverance of Roger Callahan, an eminent and highly successful American clinical psychologist. Many
practitioners now claim it has an amazing success rate of over 95%.
At the heart of his theory is the belief that behind every emotional problem is an undigested thought or ‘perturbation’.
In stressful situations our minds filter out anything we can’t cope with in order for us to deal more effectively with the
situation in hand. However, the problem here is that if these issues are permanently blocked from our awareness and
we are never given a chance to deal with, them they may eventually pop up as phobias, fears, anxieties that bear very
little or no resemblance to the original problem or situation. A mistake of the intellect during the stressful situation
leads to a ‘perturbation’ in that particular ‘thought field’. It can permanently cloud our judgement surrounding many
seemingly unconnected issues and creates further stress and often causes ill health or dis-ease. As the problem is
simply a wrongly ‘tuned’ frequency connected with that particular past event, it follows that removing or ‘re-tuning’
that thought field will resolve the issue very quickly.
Ayurveda views the mind in a similar way and uses meditation to rectify imbalanced that are present. Meditation
involves introducing a sound into the body’s vibrational field. This sound ‘resonates’ within the vibrationary blueprint
of the person and entrains his/her vibrationary field back into balance. During the practice of meditation the mind
transcends through the various ‘perturbations’ or stresses and arrives effortlessly at a state of pure awareness or restful
alertness. This is the realm of pure un-manifest consciousness (the quantum level) that is free from stress, imbalance or
‘perturbation’. As the mind is naturally drawn back from this quantum level to the manifest level of reality it entrains
the mind back into a state of normality. It infuses the mind with vibrant energy and ‘irons out’ perturbations – the more
this takes place the more often these perturbations are dissolved and collapsed and the more balanced the mind/body
becomes.
While meditation releases stresses/imbalances/perturbations on a daily basis and slowly dissolves accumulated mental
debris Thought Field Therapy rapidly tackles specific and often extreme imbalances that are causing severe problems in
the present. The two therefore work hand in hand to create balance and harmony in the physiology. Meditation gently
works away at dissolving perturbations that may cause problems in the future whilst Thought Field Therapy tackles
perturbations that have become a problem and need dissolving or collapsing quickly.
Whilst it is advisable to consult a qualified TFT practitioner if you have a severe problem, many people have cured
themselves of simple or mild anxieties, fears and phobias using the ‘algorithms’ on the following pages.

Please refer to Roger Callahan’s book ‘Tapping the healer within’ for more in-depth information.

Thought Field Therapy Instructions

3.

Tune in to the thought field – this means thinking briefly about the problem you would like to resolve (a phobia,
fear, anxiety etc) and bringing the issue briefly to the forefront of the mind.
Obtain a SUD rating – this necessitates writing down a ‘subjective unit of distress’ – using a scale of 0 –10. A
ten would be very distressful when you think of the problem, whilst a six would be less severe. A zero would
therefore indicate no distress when thinking about the problem to be dealt with – in this unique situation you
would need to put yourself in an environment where a SUD rating could be made.
Choose the algorithm which you deem most appropriate to the problem you wish to overcome and ‘tap’ the areas
indicated – the correct sequence is very important but the ‘tapping’ point is approximate (use two or three fingers
to cover the general area to be tapped)

Accomplishing goals
If you feel overwhelmed, indecisive or stressed it’s time to take stock of the situation and ascertain the reasons for your
problems. It’s time to put your life back into order and to re-assess your goals and priorities. The following
instructions and priority chart are a very simple and effective way to go about accomplishing this.
Evaluate your goals:
•
•
•
•

First decide what your goals are in life.
Now divide the list into short, medium or long-term goals.
Remember to use positive language and exchange: try, should or want, for: can, must and will.
For each goal state the reason why it’s important to you. These can be either negative or positive statements as
they can either; create greater pleasure or happiness, or; reduce pain and unhappiness.
Write down how each of these will be achieved or advanced or maintained and in what timescale.
Now commit to advancing or implementing at least one, if not all, items in this list in some way each day.
Review the list each day and change the order of priorities depending on circumstances – be flexible and
advance any items on this list as opportunities spontaneously arise.
Re-evaluate this list periodically and be prepared to change it in light of new values or beliefs.
Remember to rest and relax and take some time to yourself each day, so that you are able to notice
opportunities when they do arise, and to be able to act on them effectively and efficiently.
Remember the Ayurvedic maxim: ‘Do less and accomplish more’.

•
•
•
•
•
•

Evaluate your priorities:
•
•
•
•

To evaluate priorities for your goals use the chart below.
Try and place each goal into one of the four boxes.
The descriptions on the right of the boxes will guide you as to how you should deal with each priority.
This technique can be really useful for day-to-day tasks in the home or office - you may need to be ruthless at
times, but this will pay off in terms of reducing your stress and anxiety levels.

Top Left (section 1): These have to be dealt with as a matter of
priority; there’s little choice involved and they are, therefore, often
stressful. As life becomes more structured and orderly this section
should have less and less in it. The items that would go in here should
have been foreseen and addressed in section 2.
Top Right (section 2): List here all the things that are important to you
and have a positive, life-enhancing effect on you - socially,
professionally and personally. These are things that make you, and
everyone else around you, happier, healthier and more fulfilled. They
improve relationships at home, and at work. As this list is calmly and
efficiently advanced, there should be less and less tasks to go in the
box to the left (urgent & important).
Bottom Left (section 3): These are things often imposed on us by
other people (deadlines etc) and need not impact your life if you so
choose. They are other people’s priorities and should remain so.
Bottom Right (section 4): Delete them. Any items listed in here can be
banished from your mind - they need not impact or concern you in any
way.

126

Starting your Ayurvedic lifestyle

The best way to begin integrating an Ayurvedic lifestyle is to introduce it gradually; step by step. Start with things you
know will be relatively easy for you to do without radically changing your existing habits or lifestyle. Once you have
introduced one or two changes, and found them beneficial, introduce a couple more. Try to be patient and refrain from
introducing more changes until the ones you’ve already incorporated have become fully integrated into your daily
lifestyle. Don’t worry if you can’t follow them all of the time; just do as much as you can. In this way, the changes
you’ve made will become second nature, and your friends and family will accept that this is the new you, and leave you
to get on with it. Below is a suggested monthly plan.

Month One
•

•

•
•
•
•

Retire to bed before 10pm (you can do this gradually by going to bed 10 minutes earlier than normal for one
week. The following week, go to bed 10 minutes earlier again, and continue in a similar manner until you
reach your target).
Arise one hour before dawn (you can do this gradually by getting up 10 minutes earlier than normal for one
week. The following week, get up 10 minutes earlier again, and continue in a similar manner until you reach
your target).
Meditate for 20 minutes after your morning shower and before your evening meal.
Practice the ‘Sun Salute’ for 5 minutes before meditating.
Scrape your tongue with a tongue-scraper before brushing your teeth.
Aim to drink at least 2-3 pints of hot water each day (with lemon, ginger or peppermint).

Month Two
•
•
•
•
•
•

Continue following the practices you have integrated into your life in month one and reflect on the benefits
you have noticed so far.
Eat your largest meal of the day at mid-day.
Eat a light meal (ideally soup) before 7pm in the evening.
Take ‘ginger pickle’ before your mid-day meal to increase appetite and help digestion.
Choose the appropriate ‘churnas’ for your body-type and/or season and sprinkle on your food to balance the
tastes and increase assimilation of food.
Cut down on (or eliminate) your consumption of one or two of the following addictions: tea, coffee, sugar,
confectionary, sweets, chocolate, smoking, alcohol, watching television.

Month Three
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Continue following the practices you have integrated into your life in month one and two and reflect on the
benefits you have noticed so far.
Cut down on (or eliminate) your consumption of meat and/or dairy products.
Choose foods that are appropriate for your body-type and season.
Stop buying processed, micro-waved, low fat and refined foods.
Drink no more than one cup of hot water with meals or immediately after meals.
Avoid iced drinks and ice-cream (especially during or immediately after meals).
Cut down further on (or eliminate) your consumption of one or two of the following addictions: tea, coffee,
sugar, confectionary, sweets, chocolate, smoking, alcohol, watching television.
Take a 10 minute walk in nature each day.

127

Month Four
•
•
•
•
•
•

Continue following the practices you have integrated into your life in the previous three months and reflect on
the benefits you have noticed so far.
Massage your body with sesame oil before bathing or showering.
Massage your hair and scalp with coconut oil before bed.
Practice 5 minutes of pranayama before meditation.
Practice 10 minutes of yoga before pranayama.
Cut down further on (or eliminate) your consumption of one or two of the following addictions: tea, coffee,
sugar, confectionary, sweets, chocolate, smoking, alcohol, watching television.

Month Five
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Continue following the practices you have integrated into your life in the previous four months and reflect on
the benefits you have noticed so far.
Exchange your cosmetic products and toiletries for less toxic ones (see resources).
Read some inspiring, motivation, personal development or spiritual literature each day.
Increase your practice of yoga to 20 minutes each day.
Aim to become less argumentative, judgemental and controlling of yourself and others.
Have a day to yourself each week with plenty of rest and relaxation (and maybe a liquid fast).
Take a 20-30 minute walk in nature each day.
Cut down still further on (or eliminate) your consumption of one or two of the following addictions: tea,
coffee, sugar, confectionary, sweets, chocolate, smoking, alcohol, watching television.

Month Six
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Continue following the practices you have integrated into your life in the previous five months and reflect on
the benefits you have noticed so far.
Practice the ‘healing sounds’ for 5-10 minutes each day.
Eat a purely vegetarian diet most of the time.
Go on a panchakarma detox retreat for 7-10 days to rejuvenate and revitalise the mind and body.
Start an on-going Rasayana program taking Triphala and Chywanaprash (Amrit Kalash) daily.
Buy an auger, masticating-type juicer and start drinking fresh, organic vegetable/fruit juices every day. Choose
juices you like and are suitable for your body-type.
Fast on Peya soup for one day a week.
Eat mainly organic produce and cook it fresh each day.
Cut out tea, coffee, sugar, confectionary, sweets, chocolate, smoking and alcohol from your life.

During the following six-months slowly integrate more of these suggestions if you haven’t been able to already. Do not
be too hard on yourself. Give yourself a reasonable time frame and accept that this may be much longer than is
suggested here. It may take years until to can fully integrate everything but at least follow the most important ones;
meditation, early nights and early mornings, exercise, drinking hot water and having light meals in the evening. It is
worth noting that you may experience mild side effects such as headaches or loose bowels when you begin to cut back
on toxic substances like alcohol or coffee. This is not a cause for concern; it is just your body beginning to detoxify.
However, drinking lots of hot water will help lessen these symptoms and you can always cut back less drastically on
these substances to integrate the change more smoothly.

Introduction to mantra chanting
Mantra is a profound and practical method of accessing higher states of consciousness. It is a form of yoga which uses
vocal and mental sound-currents of both audible and inaudible frequencies. These subtle vibrations awaken dormant
centres of the brain, attuning the mind and body to the primordial vibrations of creation. Access to universal knowledge
or truth, and spontaneously self-healing, naturally arise when we come into harmony with these sub-atomic pulsations
in consciousness. The subtle harmonic vibrations of chanted mantras, both mental and vocal, act as a cleansing and
purifying agent on consciousness. The yogic rishis of ancient India discovered that certain sounds brought them joy and
ecstasy whilst others illumined the consciousness or brought tremendous psychic powers. Some produced profound
tranquility or boundless energy and others brought freedom from fear or mental and physical healing.
These same mantras are still in use today and they still evoke the same results in those who are dedicated to practicing
them regularly. Mantras create a stable core in the centre of our beings, which vibrates in unison with the underlying
life force. In India, it is not unusual for homeopathic doctors to prescribe specific mantras instead of the usual remedies.
In Africa witch-doctors have known for centuries that a certain frequency of drum-beat will serve to break a fever and
have developed a repertoire of other rhythms to cure various physical and mental symptoms. Similar methods are used
today by advanced radionic practitioners using sophisticated instruments. Even in allopathic circles, sound-therapy is
beginning to be utilised in the treatment of both physical and mental problems.
It is only relatively recently in the Western world, that it has been discovered that certain music and sound-waves have
the capacity to activate cellular healing when played to bodily wounds. And such sounds have been shown to promote a
far speedier return to health than by orthodox methods. So it is that medical science begins to vindicate the findings of
the ancient sages.
What is an ordinary dose of allopathic medicine after all? It is no more than a substance composed of atomic particles in
a dense state of vibration. Homeopathic medicine goes one step further. Its highly diluted remedies appear to contain
nothing of the original substance, yet they are highly potentised and radiate a powerful frequency which can replicate
the effects of the disease. This causes the body to throw off its illness without the effects of harmful drugs, simply by a
sympathetic frequency. A sonic frequency works on a similar principle.
Medical researchers in Paris have found that certain repetitive sounds played to cancer cells will eventually destroy
them. If lifeless repetitive electronic sound can make cancer cells disintegrate in the laboratory, how much more
effective the living sound of one’s own voice can be in toning the cells with the repetitive vibration of healing.
Mantra is known for its vibrant pulsation of subtle healing frequencies which purify both mind and body. Because of its
capacity to resonate in consciousness, it is considered by the great sages as the most efficacious method of unburdening
the subconscious and cleansing it of residual traumas. As many cancers can be traced back to unfelt feelings blocked in
childhood, mantra (with its internal massage of rigid cellular structures) often allows such frozen pains and tears to be
released. On occasion even traumas of previous lifetimes have been experienced following a mantra session, allowing
students to relive and release past-life memories which previously created hidden tensions in the body.
It is hardly surprising that mantra chanting also has a significant effect on our mind and body as, like everything else in
this universe, our body is made up of vibrating energy. Even though our body appears to be dense, every cell of the
human body has its own frequency. There's a sound present in each tiny cell, however minute that cell might be.
Wherever there's movement, wherever there's vibration, there's sound. The body's inclination is to be in harmony with
itself. All the different parts of the body, all its cells, want to move in unison, the way a shoal of fish or a flock of birds
does, always moving but never bumping into each other. When this natural rhythm and harmony is disrupted in the
body, disease and disorders arise. However, when the vibrations of a chant sound within our bodies, the cells
themselves respond; they resonate with the pure vibration of the mantras so that harmony can be restored. The mantras
and chants on the following pages are just a short selection for you to experiment with.

Bija Shakti Mantras
These are powerful mantras for general healing, energy and transformation purposes.
They allow us to unify with Shakti (the realm of pure consciousness).
Oṁ
This is said to be the most important mantra as it serves to energize or empower everything in the universe. For this
reason, all mantras begin and end with the sound of OM. Chanting this sound helps clear the mind, opens the channels
of perception and increases our life-energy or Ojas. In ancient books OM is said to be the sound of the Sun and carries
the energy of Prana on its breath.
Shrīṁ
Shrim (shreem) is a mantra of love, devotion, health, beauty, creativity and prosperity. It awakens the heart, engenders
faith and gives steadiness to our emotional nature. It promotes general health and aids in fertility and rejuvenation.
Hrīṁ
Hrim (hreem) is a mantra of cleansing, purification and detoxification. It gives energy, joy and bliss and has creative and
healing powers that awaken us, at a soul or heart level, to the divine forces of love and attraction. It increases our
aspiration and receptivity to divine light, wisdom and truth and opens the lotus of the heart to the inner Sun of
consciousness.
Krīṁ
Krim (kreem) gives us motivation, energy, power and efficacy for work and action. It is good to chant while making
preparations as it allows them to work better. It brings spiritual awareness and power by arousing kundalini and
opening the third eye. It can stimulate and transform the lower chakras and helps awaken and purify the subtle body.
Krim is the thunderbolt or vajra of Indra that destroys the serpent of ignorance and releases the light of absolute truth.
Huṁ
Hum is a mantra of Agni or fire and helps enkindle our inner fire or thermogenic force and our digestive fire. It also
represents the soul hidden in the body and calls the divine down into us. It may be used to destroy negativity and create
great passion and vitality. It governs the earth and the material sphere in general and can be used to invoke divine grace
and protection through which we can offer ourselves or our afflictions into the divine for purification and
transformation. It is the best mantra for warding off negative influences attacking us, whether disease-causing
pathogens, negative emotions or even black magic.
Oṁ Hrīṁ Krīṁ Huṁ Shrīṁ
These are the four great Goddess mantras that govern the prime forms of energy as magnetic force, electrical force, heat,
and delight. These four mantras can be used together with OM to get an extremely powerful mantra which can bring
about an integral development of body, mind and soul in harmony with the Divine or Inner Self.
Rāṁ
Ram (rarm) is the best mantra for drawing down the protective light and grace of the Divine. It gives strength, calm,
rest and peace and is particularly good for high Vata and mental disorders.

Additional mantra information
LAKSHMI MANTRA
Om Gum Shrim Maha Lakshmiyei Swaha
Let all obstacles to my abundance be eliminated and the flow of the shakti of abundance released within me
This mantra is used to remove karmic obstacles related to abundance and to the attraction of finances or prosperity.
Om: seed sound for the sixth (Ajna) chakra or "third eye" (located in the centre of the forehead, about a half-inch above the line of the
eyebrows, sometimes referred to as the mystic "third eye"). From here, the principle of mind directs all that follows in the rest of the
mantra.
Gum: seed sound for Ganapati, a form of Ganesha, the Hindu God known as the remover of obstacles, who is often portrayed in the
form of an elephant.
Shrim: seed sound for Lakshmi and refers to abundance of all kinds.
Maha: a salutation that means both "great" and "heart-centered"
Lakshmi: the feminine principle.
Yei: a shakti-activating sound.
Swaha: a traditional ending of mantras, where its meaning is "I salute and by so doing I automatically invoke her power:'
KUBERA MANTRA
(the celestial guardian of riches)
Ha Sa Ka La E I La Hrim
Ha Sa Ka La E I La Hrim
There is no translation possible of this mantra, since it is composed solely of seed syllables.
This mantra is used to attain great wealth that once achieved will be self-sustaining. This is particularly true if you are in an
occupation where you safeguard money or investments for others. Kubera is often referred to as the celestial who is the Divine
Treasurer. So if you are an investment counsellor, stock broker, real estate broker, or work in some similar capacity, this mantra will
greatly aid in the discharging of your financial responsibilities while also providing you with abundance.
Ha Sa: bring energy to the Ajna chakra.
Ka La: brings the energy of the Ajna chakra into connection with the Kala (Ka La) chakra, literally the wheel of time, located in the
upper chest between the heart centre and the throat centre.
E: (pronounced e-e-e-e) sends energy from the medulla oblongata (located at the base of the skull) down the back side of the spine to
the Muladhara (first) chakra, at the base of the spine.
I: this is really the sounds Ah and E. Ah resounds in the upper chest, and E works again as discussed earlier.
La: the seed sound of the first chakra (Lam) with the m left off. This means that the sound La is voiced, but the vibration is just short
of actual anchoring on the Earth Plane since it is the voiced m on the end of any seed sound that would anchor it here on the Earth
Plane.
Hrim: the seed sound of the esoteric Hrit Padma (also called the Hridayam in some texts) located two fingers below the Anahata chakra,
which corresponds to the heart centre in the physical body.
A SHIVA MANTRA
(for fulfilment of desires)
Om Sarva Kamadaya Namaha
Salutations to the granter of desires.
This mantra is used to petition the Great Consciousness to fulfil our individual desires. Every desire is tied to our consciousness and
this mantra attracts the elements of universal consciousness that fulfil desires strongly held by the mind.
This is a Shiva mantra because it is addressed to Shakti, or the primal energy of Shiva that rises out of the wellspring of compassion,
and thus is automatically part of sentient self-consciousness existing everywhere in the universe.
Sarva can mean "source of." Used here, the implication is that desires are part of the nature of universal consciousness and naturally
arise in individual consciousness. In fact, the tales and parables concerning Shiva invariably show him absorbed in contemplating his
own nature, just as we are completely consumed with the details of our own lives. Only when one merges into universal truth so
completely that individual existence ceases altogether does desire, in our normal understanding of the word, cease.
Om: The seed sound for the sixth (Ajna) chakra, from which the principle of mind directs all that follows.
Sarva: source of.
Kamadaya: that which grants fulfilment of desires.
Namaha: I invoke by saluting.

137

DHANVANTRE MANTRA
Om Shri Dhanvantre Namaha
This mantra is used to find the best resolution for a medical problem
One of the tasks we all face when a health problem arises is finding an appropriate physician or practitioner for our problem among
so many choices. In Hinduism, the celestial healer or physician is known as Dhanvantre, and his mantra is chanted when one is
looking for guidance to find the most appropriate path to healing.
Om: the seed sound for the sixth (Ajna) chakra, from which the principle of mind directs all that follows.
Shri: invoking the power of Lakshmi, the transcendental power of manifestation.
Dhanvantre: the celestial healer.
Namaha: I invoke by saluting.
GAYATRI MANTRA
Om Bhu, Bhuvaha, Swaha
Tat Savitur Varenyam
Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi
Dhiyo Yonaha Prachodayat
O Self-Effulgent Light that has given birth to all the lokas spheres of consciousness, who is worthy of worship and appears through the orbit of
the Sun, illumine our intellect.

The Gayatri Mantra is a gift to the world from the great rishi Vishvamitra, the seer of the third book of the Rig Veda. It helps carry solar
light, energy and power to our minds and bodies and is the best mantra for awakening the higher mind or soul.
This mantra is used to illuminate our intellect. Saying this mantra automatically supports dharma in the world as well as your
individual swadharma, a word that refers to the law of your own being or nature. As this mantra is chanted over time, spiritual light
is drawn into each chakra, starting at the base of the spine. Correspondingly, our ability to comprehend the essence of each of the
realms grows. In meditation, travel of consciousness to the higher realms becomes possible as new faculties of consciousness grow
from our practice. The Gayatri Mantra is a universe in miniature through the power of sound. It appears in the Rig Veda in a form of
twenty-four Sanskrit syllables. For this reason, it is widely practiced in India in this form. It is said to contain all powers of all
mantras, and is also known as the source of all knowledge and the "Mother of the Vedas," but its primary application is for
illumination of the intellect. An illumined intellect can contain immeasurable knowledge, including a complete understanding of
what we call "power:" Those who have attained the full fruit of this mantra are in the company of the highest beings in the universe.
Om Bhur: Om and Salutations to the Earth Plane (Ist chakra).
Bhuvaha: salutations to the Atmospheric Plane (2nd chakra).
Swaba: salutations to the Solar Region (3rd chakra).
Tat Savitur Yarenyam: salutations to that realm which is beyond human comprehension.
Bbargo Devasya Dbimabi: in that place where all the celestials of all the spheres have ...
Dhiyo Yonaba Pracbodayat: received enlightenment, kindly enlighten our intellect.

GREAT MANI MANTRA
Om Mani Padme Hum
The Jewel of consciousness has reached the heart's Lotus.
Use this mantra to unite heart and mind. The circulation of energy through the centres listed below builds links among mind, will,
and heart. There is a saying in the East, "When the light of the heart is united with power of the mind, anything is possible:"
The Great Mani Mantra is the most often chanted mantra in the world. Pulling energy from the lower chakras into the upper ones, it
activates these centres and circulates energy around them, magnetizing the upper spine so that the energy in the subtle body
becomes centered in the upper part of the body. The heart and mental chakras become predominant, leading to the ability to exist as
a conscious entity without a physical body. As with the Gayatri Mantra, when this mantra is chanted by anyone, all of humanity is
benefited.
Om: activates the Ajna chakra between the eyebrows.
Mani: sends energy to the Manas chakra in the back of the head.
Padme: in this context, Padme sends energy to the Anahata chakra at the heart.
Hum: a seed sound that activates the Vishuddha chakra at the throat.

138

DATTATREYA MANTRA
Om Dram Om Guru Dattaya Namaha
Salutations to the Eternal Enlightener of souls.
Use this mantra to sharpen your skills as a spiritual counsellor and teacher, as well as moving your personal dharma forward. This
mantra invokes Dattatreya’s energy into your life and activities.
The ancient spiritual being Dattatreya, who transmitted spiritual knowledge and eliminated karma for some of his students, is the first
known guru in the specific application of the word. There were sages (rishis) and beings of great knowledge and power (Maha Siddhas)
who often acted in the role of teacher or spiritual benefactor to students, but Dattatreya was the first recorded being whose primary job
was the leading of souls back to their highest divinity. The syllables Gu and Ru refer to that which dispels the darkness of ignorance,
leading to the release of the actual spiritual light within. The nimbus or halo of the saints and sages is a well-known manifestation of
this light.
Om: the seed sound activating the Ajna chakra at the brow centre.
Dram: the seed sound for the Guru Principle manifesting in a form, usually meaning a physical body.
Guru: the transcendental principle of enlightenment, spiritual instruction, and Grace of God that can manifest at any time, any place,
through any thing or entity, physical or non-physical. The operation of this is a true spiritual mystery, and there are no limits placed
upon how this principle may manifest.
Dattaya: refers to and invokes the presence of that entity who exists, but without a physical body, who is the primal and first individual
guru whose sole purpose was the redemption of souls.
Namaha: the energy of salutation that automatically invokes that which precedes it.
VASUDEVA MANTRA
Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya
Om is the name of the In-dweller who is in constant contact with all of creation. Salutations.
Use this mantra to obtain spiritual freedom. The essence of the Divine is everywhere, but we identify with our individual egocentered existence. This mantra builds a link between conscious divinity at every level of creation and our own ego-based
consciousness. Eventually, our sense of identity changes to include all life, even as we know we are living in an individual body.
The Sanskrit term Vasudeva means "the In-dweller" referring to the soul or atman. Since the soul is always divine and a part of God
everywhere, the Vasudeva Mantra, at an advanced level, can be a vehicle for uniting with divinity anywhere in the cosmos.
The mechanics of the mantra are simple: When the twelve syllables are chanted, energy is rotated around the spine, stimulating the
positive and negative poles of the chakras. The energy first goes down the spine, then back up. After the mantra is chanted many
thousands of times, energy is rotated around the spine to such an extent that it becomes spiritually magnetized. This allows for
higher vibrations and octaves of spiritual energy to be invoked and held in the subtle body. Finally, the subtle body becomes so
energy-based that it can ultimately survive without its physical counterpart.
Om: the seed sound for the sixth (Ajna) chakra, from which the principle of mind directs all that follows.
Namo: here means "name of."
Bbagavate: our own completely integrated divine self that we are in the process of becoming.
Vasudevaya: the in-dwelling divinity that you are entreating to permeate your mind, personality, ego, and being.
TARAKA RAMA MANTRA
Om Sri Rama Jay Rama Jaya Jaya Rama
Om and victory to Rama and Sita, victory to Rama again and again.
Use this mantra to begin the process of purification of the ego and personality that will eventually lead to spiritual freedom. In this
mantra, Rama is the divine self within. All difficulties and problems, including eradication of karma itself, can be solved if we allow
the divinity within to handle everything. This is the "victory" of the self within that is indicated in the translation.
Om: the seed sound for the sixth (Ajna) chakra, from which the principle of mind directs all that follows.
Sri: refers to the all-powerful energy of Sita. Jaya: victory.
Rama: the syllables Ra and Ma balance energy in the masculine and feminine channels in the body, located on the right and left sides
of the body, respectively. As Rama, it also refers to the avatar himself, as well as to the divine self within.
Taraka means that which "takes one across:" In this case, the "across" refers to the ocean of rebirth, this samsara that keeps us coming
back again and again to assume bodies and burn off, as well as accumulate, karma. This mantra, practiced by Mahatma Gandhi from
the time he was a young boy, will free one from the round of rebirth. Gandhi was heard to say "Hey Ram" at the time of his death,
when he was pierced by an assassin's bullet. In The Ramayana, the epic story of the life of Sita and Rama (the seventh Avatar of
Vishnu), this and other mantras pertaining to Sita and Rama are given. However, this particular mantra is uniformly recommended
for transcending karma.

139

Overtoning
This chanting technique requires no singing skills whatsoever and can easily be accomplished by anyone with a little
practice. It is practiced by Tibetan monks to achieve higher states of consciousness but is also a very pleasant way to
quickly re-balance the mind and effectively remove stress and tension from the body. It is very effective for improving
hearing and increasing alertness.
Overtoning produces harmonics or pure notes and their flute-like sounds ethereally hover above the base tone or drone.
The deep, resonant sound is produced by making a deep ‘ooooo’ sound in the back of the throat and then altering the
position of the tongue and shape of the mouth to produce variations of that sound. The tongue is curled up and bends
back towards the roof of the mouth and is then gradually moved forward. The resonance is amplified by pursing the
lips, flattening the cheeks (the mouth slightly open) and allowing air to flow between the tip of the tongue and the roof
of the mouth; the mouth being the hollow resonating chamber. A deep sound is produced with the tip of the tongue near
the back of the mouth and a higher sound with the tip of the tongue towards the front of the mouth, just behind the
upper teeth. By slowly saying a long, drawn-out ‘onre’ as the tongue gradually unfurls towards the front teeth, the
correct sound is produced. The deeper ‘ooo’ or ‘uuu’ vowel sounds are produced when the tongue is near the epiglottis
and the higher ‘iii’ and ‘eee’ vowel sounds are produced when the tongue is near the upper front teeth.
If the tongue touches the roof of the mouth and air isn’t able to pass over it the sound stops resonating and becomes flat.
As you become familiar with the technique you can experiment with altering the shape of the mouth, as well as the
tongue, to produce a clearer, more rounded, resonating note.
Try experimenting by imitating the noise of a model aeroplane as it twists and turns above you or a racing car hurtling
round a racetrack. If you’re not familiar with this sound ask any eight year old to demonstrate – they’re usually pretty
good! This isn’t ‘over-toning’ as it varies in pitch but its practice involves similar mouth movements. The harmonics a
Tibetan singing bowl produces when struck are overtones of a single note, and as one listens more closely more
overtones are often ‘picked up’.
As you continue practicing overtoning, harmonics will certainly be produced, though they are often difficult to pick up
yourself until your ears becomes ‘tuned-in’ to them. Other people can often hear them before you do but if you practice
in a good resonating chamber, that echoes the sounds around, you’ll notice them much more quickly. Large, empty
rooms, bathroom sinks, tunnels, bridges and churches work especially well. Cupping your hands behind your ears also
helps and practicing with other people can produce quite phenomenal sounds, especially if the room you’re in is very
resonant.
As you begin to hear the harmonics appearing above or alongside the basic tone/drone you’ll begin to sensitise the
hearing process and begin to find interesting, captivating sounds in the most unusual places and from the most
unexpected sources. The sound of a washing machine or train can suddenly become an enthralling and tantalising
experience to the ear that’s ‘tuned in’ to their harmonics. As you begin to explore this new realm of sound you may
find that you aren’t tone deaf and can sing a few notes and keep in tune after all.
You will most likely find that as you progress ,your breathing improves, your voice becomes clearer and more resonant,
and notes that you sing become sharper and more ‘bell-like’.

Everyone should be his own physician. We ought to assist and not force nature.
Eat with moderation and with what agrees with your constitution.
Nothing is good for the body but what we can digest.
What medicine can produce digestion? Exercise

Mung beans are sweet and astringent in initial taste, sweet in post digestive effect, energetically cooling and balancing to
all three doshas. They are easily digested, particularly good for pitta types and excellent during the summer to combat
heat. They are light on the digestion and calm and balance the mind (sattvic). They are refrigerant, antipyretic, alterative
and haemostatic. They are good for febrile diseases, lung, liver, spleen and bleeding disorders, cancer, fever, heat stroke
and alcohol detoxification. A plaster or poultice can be made from mung bean flour to draw toxins from the body and for
treating burns, sores, inflamed or swollen joints, swollen breast, mastitis and breast cancer.
Basmati rice is sweet, both in initial taste and post-digestive effect, energetically neutral and balancing to all three
doshas. It is easy to digest, a tonic for the body, soothing to the mucus membranes (demulcent) and nutritive (helps build
the tissues) and mildly laxative. It is not clogging and very sattvic (clarifies and calms the mind). It is high in B-complex
vitamins and generally well tolerated food in conditions of anorexia, poor digestion and vomiting. It is detoxifying and an
excellent convalescence food; it is also good for breaking a fast. Kicharee, a combination of basmati rise and split mung
beans, is an excellent staple diet for maintaining good health and in treating many diseases. However, bleached, refined
rice is sticky and can increase kapha and ama in the body. Whilst brown rise is higher in nutritional status because it does
not have the hull, bran and germ polished off, it is more perishable and much harder to digest. Therefore, Ayurveda sees
white basmati rice as the preferred grain as its nutrients are more easily available and better assimilated by the tissues.

Fruit & vegetable juices
Homemade fruit & vegetable juices
A delight to the taste buds and an elixir of life to the body. They contain an abundant supply of vitamins,
minerals, antioxidants, and nutritional enzymes and are easily digested by the body. One or two pints of juice
per day can be consumed but raw/cooked fruits and vegetables should also form part of a daily diet to help
cleanse the colon and keep it functioning properly.
Vata balancing juices:
Apple (good for headaches, asthma and arthritis)
Lemon & ginger (good for migraines)
Beetroot, carrot & cucumber (good for headaches and weight loss)
Apple, guava & potato (good for insomnia)
Grape (good for rheumatism, dry skin, constipation)
Beetroot (good for gaining weight and as a liver cleanser)
Apricot, cranberry, orange, peach, pineapple, pomegranate (variety of combination)
Asparagus, carrot, cucumber, green beans, turnip, pumpkin (variety of combinations)
Pitta balancing juices:
Carrot & ginger (good for eyes)

160

Other drinks & digestives
Hot water
Boil water, preferably distilled, and then pour into a small, stainless steel flask. Small sips should be taken
frequently throughout the day. Hot water reduces toxicity/impurities in the tissues and is very good for digestion
and weight loss. It is balancing to the physiology of all body types and is a general cleanser and purifier of the
body. Add fresh ginger, lemon or peppermint for extra flavour if desired.

Nourishing milk drink
1 cup of organic milk
2 tsp of root ginger
Pinch of cardamom
½ inch of vanilla pod

8 – 10 raisins
Pinch of turmeric
½ tsp Ghee
Pinch of nutmeg

Place all the ingredients (except ghee) in a heavy bottomed, stainless steel saucepan. Bring slowly to the boil
and simmer for two minutes, stirring continuously. Add ghee, pour into cup and drink slowly. Soya or rice milk
may be used for those who are lactose intolerant. Boiling milk breaks down it’s proteins making it much easier
to digest and causing less congestion/mucus than if taken cold – it should not be taken with meals but alone for
breakfast and/or before bedtime.
According to Ayurvedic texts milk is rejuvenating, strengthening and nourishing – it also soothes the mind and
promotes longevity. It is high in calcium and, contrary to popular belief, has been shown to lower cholesterol
levels. Even people diagnosed with lactose intolerances are able to digest small quantities of boiled milk,
especially once the above ingredients are added.

Ginger pickle
½ tsp ginger
½ tsp lemon juice
½ tsp honey
Salt

grated
freshly squeezed
cold-pressed/organic
pinch

The above is enough for one serving but it is far more convenient to make one week’s supply at a time.
To do this, simply grate enough fresh ginger to fill half a jam jar, cover with lemon juice and store in a
refrigerator. Twenty minutes before lunch and evening meal take 1 tsp. of the ginger/lemon mix, add honey (to
taste) and a pinch of salt.
Taking ginger pickle regularly helps maintain a strong, healthy digestion and improves the
metabolism/assimilation of nutrients from the food you intake. From an Ayurvedic standpoint, it contains all six
tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent) required to satisfy the palate and leaves the body feeling
balanced and satisfied after eating.

Date recipe
Soak 10-15 dates overnight. Cook for 10-15 minutes, remove stones and then blend with 1 tsp ghee and a pinch
of cardamom. This is good with breakfast or as an afternoon pick-me-up as it feeds and nourishes the
physiology on a very deep level.

161

Milk Drinks
(Add to soups, deserts, breakfast cereals & sauces)

Coconut milk
500ml hot water

180g coconut – grated

Puree the water and coconut in a blender until fairly smooth and allow to stand for 10 minutes. Line a sieve with
a piece of muslin and strain the liquid through it. Squeeze out any remaining liquid from the cloth. This drink is
balancing for vata and pitta dosha types.

Almond milk
½ cup almonds
500 – 700mls water (hot or cold)
Soak the almonds overnight in a little water. Drain and then grind the nuts and then place in a blender with the
water and mix until smooth.

Pumpkin or sunflower seed milk
½ cup pumpkin seeds (or sunflower seeds)
500 - 700mls water
Grind the seeds and then place in a blender and mix until smooth.

Soy milk
170g soya beans
1 ltr water (hot or cold)
Clean the beans and soak overnight in plenty of water. Puree the beans and water in a blender until smooth and
then strain the mixture through a muslin cloth. It may be stored refrigerated for up to a week.

162

Ghee
Making ghee at home
•

Place 2 lb of UNSALTED, organic butter into a heavy bottomed, stainless steel saucepan and slowly
melt on a low heat.

•

Continue to cook slowly, keeping a wary eye all the while as it burns easily if heated too fast or on too
high a heat. Bubbles will be seen rising to the surface and a residue of milk solids will be seen forming
on the surface. This usually clears in the middle allowing you to observe the liquid changing colour
beneath and milk solids forming on the base of the pan.

•

When ready (about 30 mins), the ghee turns a transparent golden brown colour and bubbles begin to
stop rising to the surface (the bubbles are the water content of the butter evaporating). The ghee burns
very quickly at this stage so remove from the heat as soon as the milk solids on the bottom of the pan
begin to turn brown and most of the bubbles have stopped rising.

•

Wait until the ghee has cooled but is still in a liquid form and then strain the ghee through a piece of
muslin cloth into a suitable container - jam jars work well.

•

Ghee has a long shelf life if stored in tightly sealed jars. Refrigeration is unnecessary.

Why is it so good for you?
•

Ghee is cow’s butter with the milk solids and water content removed and is a very pure food. It aids
digestion, strengthens the body, increases energy levels, improves memory and brain functioning and
increases longevity.

•

It strengthens and balances the physiology but doesn’t raise cholesterol or clog the liver and arteries.
This is due to its chemical makeup - predominantly short-chain fatty acids which are easily absorbed,
assimilated and metabolised by the body for energy release. Ghee is high in antioxidants (free radical
scavengers) and high in monounsaturated fatty acids, which are associated with the prevention of cancer
and heart disease. It also contains linoleic acid, a chemical that may have anti-carcinogenic properties,
as well as vitamins A, D, E & K.

•

Taking 1 tsp to 2 tbsp daily will greatly improve your health but any more than that will start to have
the opposite effect and reduce digestive efficiency.

•

Ghee can be spread on toast, used to fry herbs and spices or simply added to vegetables during cooking.
It can also be used medicinally to help heal burns, reduce skin inflammations and on haemorrhoids and
eczema where it is especially effective combined with equal parts of pure Aloe Vera gel.

163

How to make chapatis
Ingredients:
1 cup chapatti flour
Cold water
•

Mix the chapatti flour with enough water to make a soft dough ball.

•

Kneed for two to five minutes.

•

Cover the dough with a small damp towel/kitchen roll.

•

Leave in the fridge for half an hour.

•

Kneed the dough again for two to five minutes.

•

Divide dough into four to six small balls.

•

Roll each ball into very thin saucer-sized chapattis on a ‘floured’ board.

•

Heat a flat skillet or frying pan (med. heat).

•

Place one chapatti on the skillet for approx. 30 secs.

•

Turn over with a fish slice and heat until it begins to rise a little.

•

Turn the chapatti over again and remove once it has risen slightly.

•

Repeat this process with the rest of the chapattis.

•

Serve with a drizzle of ghee or Udo’s oil.

(opt: Vata churna can be added to the dough mix at the start of the process)

Inspirational quotes & sayings
~ from around the world & through the ages ~

I was free and I had shrunk. I was so tiny, almost like a minute particle of dust.
Everything was within me. The whole Universe was inside me.
Light beings disappeared and new ones appeared.
We were linked together with connecting radiating beams.
We were as one. We are all connected with each other.
If we only realised how closely we are connected,
we would never be able to hurt each other.
~ Shanti Devi ~

Desiderata
Go placidly amid the noise and the haste
And remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
Speak the truth clearly, and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant:
They too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself to others you may become vain and bitter,
For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
Keep interested in your career however humble;
It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you from what virtue there is;
Many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.
Be yourself, especially do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of years gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture the strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not stress yourself with imaginings.
Many fatigues are born of fear and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.
You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars:
You have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.
Therefore be at peace with God,
Whatever you conceive Him to be.
Whatever your labours and aspiration, in the noisy confusion of life,
Keep peace with your soul.
With all its shams, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.
Be careful.
Strive to be happy.
Unknown

Learn to be silent.
Let your quiet mind listen and absorb.
Pythagoras

All man’s miseries derive from not being able to sit quietly in a room alone.

Do not be desirous of having things done quickly.
Do not look at small advantages.
Desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly.
Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being accomplished.
Confucius

When you are inspired by some great purpose,
some extraordinary project,
all your thoughts break their bonds;
your mind transcends limitations,
your consciousness expands in every direction,
and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world.
Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive,
and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far
than you every dreamed yourself to be.
Patanjali

Men are disturbed not by things that happen,
but by their opinions of the things that happen.
Epicitetus

God sleeps in the minerals,
awakens in the plants,
walks in the animals,
and thinks in you.
Ancient Sanskrit saying

Before enlightenment; chopping wood, carrying water.
After enlightenment; chopping wood, carrying water.
Zen proverb

Every now and then go away, have a little relaxation,
For when you come back to your work your judgement will be surer;
Since to remain constantly at work will cause you to lose power of judgement…
Go some distance away because the work appears smaller and more of it can be
taken in at a glance, and a lack of harmony or proportion is more readily seen.
Leonardo Da Vinci

The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it,
but that it is too low and we reach it.
Michelangelo

Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition form mediocre minds.
Albert Einstein

Look well to this day for it is life; the very best of life.
In its brief course lie all the realities and truths of existence.
The joy of growth; the splendour of action; the glory of power.
For yesterday is only a memory and tomorrow is only a vision,
But today, if well lived, makes every yesterday a memory of happiness
and every tomorrow a vision of hope.
Look well therefore to this day.
Ancient Sanskrit poem

To live a creative life we must lose our fear of being wrong.
Joseph Chilton Pearce

In creating, the only hard part is to begin.
James Russell Lowell

Emotions are like guests. They should be treated very nicely and gently, and sent
away if they don’t fit in.
Yogi Bhajan

Your heart has not to open to others.
Your heart has to open to yourself.
Yogi Bhajan

If somebody is terribly bad, thank God that it is not you.
And if somebody is terribly good, thank God that you have seen something good,
and that it could be you.
Yogi Bhajan

Your brain will release thoughts, one thousand per wink of the eye. So you have
no thinking power; you only have pursuing power. It is up to you which thoughts
you will pursue.
Yogi Bhajan

When a negative thought hits you, hit it with a positive thought – you will come
out the best.
Yogi Bhajan

You will be tested – but that is the nature of life. When it is rough, be very calm.
Go inside and find your soul. Be neutral and meditate, and the way will become
more clear.
Yogi Bhajan

Go inside and listen to your inner voice. Every question has an answer. Your soul
is full of wisdom and knows the way.
It is very important that we work to develop our intuitive power (which comes
through meditation), for without intuition, we have doubt, which in turn creates
duality and leads us into crisis in our lives.
Yogi Bhajan

Going through life without intuition is like driving a car which has no side
mirror and no rear-view mirror. All you can see is just straight ahead. Yogi Bhajan
If you can’t see God in All,
Then you can’t see God at all.
Yogi Bhajan

If we think of defeat, that is what we get
If we are undecided, nothing will happen to us.
We must just pick something great and do it.
Never think of failure at all,
For as we are now, that is what we get.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

Enjoy your life and be happy,
Being happy is of utmost importance.
Success in anything is through happiness,
More support of nature comes through being happy.
Under all circumstances be happy,
Even if you have to force it a little to change long-standing habits.
Just think of any negativity that comes to you
As a raindrop falling on your ocean of bliss.
You may not always have an ocean of bliss,
But think that way anyway as it will help it to come.
Doubting is not blissful and does not create happiness.
Be happy, healthy and let all that love
Flow through your heart.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

Keep your desires turning within and be patient.
Allow the fulfilment to come to you
Gently resist the temptation to chase your dreams into the world.
Pursue them in your heart until they disappear into the self,
And leave them there.
It may take a little discipline – be simple, be kind, stay rested.
Attend to your own inner health and happiness.
Happiness radiates like the fragrance from a flower
And draws all good things towards you.
Allow your love to nourish yourself as well as others.
Do not strain after your needs in life –
It is sufficient to be quietly alert and aware of them.
In this way life proceeds more naturally, effortlessly.
Life is here to enjoy.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

When we live in the present nature works out our destiny.
Nature is the best organiser.
Simplicity and naturalness will bring success.
Naturalness is the basis of happiness.
If one poses to be someone else, one looses the charm of naturalness.
The result is that one accumulates a stress.
We do not think of life, we live it.
We do not think of ourselves too much.
We do not think of others too much.
We just behave in a natural way.
We do not make moods, or wonder what anyone thinks of us.
We do not live life on the remarks of others.
What others think is not our concern – it is their concern.
If we are weak we will always put ourselves at the whim of others.
We do not base our lives on the opinions of others.
But if we are not clear in our conscience, then we will always be weak
And will always mind the looks and remarks of other people.
It is important only that we radiate life.
Every individual must be a joy to himself, to his family and to society.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

170

Do not oppose, because in opposing the tenderness of the feeling level is crushed.
All action should be to develop the fine feelings developed in the Sidhis.
This is why we say speak the Truth; but see that you are speaking delicately.
Do not speak non-truth and do not speak in a non-sweet way,
So that the feeling is nourished.
The whole effect of activity is to enrich the feeling of the other.
Be as delicate as possible.
If a communication accomplishes something on the gross
But damages something on the level of feeling, then it is a spiritual loss.
The feeling is more important to life.
Nourishment of the feeling is the basis for growth of spiritual holistic value.
Delicate behaviour on the surface should be as to nourish, uphold and enhance
The transcendental value where feelings merge into a common source.
Do not oppose; opposition is dangerous to immortality.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

If a man does not keep pace with his companions,
perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.
Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured and far away.

A man and a woman were walking along a beach
where thousands of starfish had washed up.
The woman kept bending down and throwing starfish back into the water.

what difference are you making.
She bent down again and threw another into the water, replying, “It made a
difference to that one.”

Constant kindness can accomplish much.
As the sun makes ice melt,
kindness causes misunderstanding, mistrust, and hostility to evaporate.
Albert Schweitzer
The difference between great people and everyone else
is that great people create their lives actively,
while everyone else is created by their lives,
passively waiting to see where life takes them next.
The difference between the two is the difference
between living fully and just existing.
Michael E. Gerber
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch,
a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment,
or the smallest act of caring,
all of which have the potential to turn a life around.
Leo Buscaglia
If you don't follow through on your creative ideas,
someone else will pick them up and use them.
When you get an idea of this sort, you should jump in with both feet,
not just stick your toe in the water...
Be daring, be fearless,
and don't be afraid that somebody is going to criticise you or laugh at you.
If your ego is not involved no one can hurt you.
Guru R.H.H
Nothing would be done at all

An old man was walking along the beach,
when he came upon a part of the sand
where thousands of starfish had washed ashore.
A little further down the beach he saw a young woman,
who was picking up the starfish one at a time
and tossing them back into the ocean.
"Oh you silly girl," he exclaimed.
"You can't possibly save all of these starfish. There's too many."
The woman smiled and said, "I know. But I can save this one, "
and she tossed another into the ocean,
"and this one", toss, "and this one..."

Japanese Proverb

Detachment is not indifference.
It is the prerequisite for effective involvement.
Often what we think is best for others
is distorted by our attachments to our opinions.
We want others to be happy in the way we think they should be happy.
It is only when we want nothing for ourselves
that we are able to see clearly into others needs
and understand how to serve them.

Toxins in your bathroom?
Nowadays it is widely known that whatever is placed on the skin is readily absorbed and can enter the bloodstream
and subsequently enter the body’s deepest tissues in a mater of seconds. Although this is beyond dispute,
manufacturers of cosmetic and bathroom products still allow potentially toxic substances to be included in their
products; substances that are also used in the manufacturing industry with health warnings associated with them.
Listed below are some of the ingredients to watch out for.
Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS): One of the commonest foaming and bulking agents used in cosmetics. It is also
used as an engine de-greaser, garage floor cleaner and car wash detergent. It readily penetrates the skin and can
accumulate in our bodily tissues causing damage and irritation to the skin. It also damages the immune system and
can cause hair loss with long-term use. It has been associated with the formation of cataracts, gum disease and
mouth ulcers.
Propylene Glycol: A petrochemical solvent used in anti-freeze, de-icer, paint, floor wax, brake and hydraulic fluid,
pet food and many cosmetic and personal care products. It is a humectant or moisture retainer and prevents things
drying out. It can make the skin feel smooth but beyond that it has no therapeutic benefits. It has been implicated
with contact dermatitis, kidney damage and liver abnormalities. It may cause skin rashes, gastro-intestinal
disturbances, nausea, headaches, vomiting and central nervous system depression.
Fluoride: It is found in most toothpaste products and has been shown to be poisonous when ingested over long
periods as it steadily accumulates in our tissues.
Talc: This is chemically similar to asbestos and is a known cancer causing substance. It is used as a dry lubricant
on surgical gloves, condoms, personal-care powders and many cosmetics. It clogs the pores and has been linked to
post-operative peritonitis and fibrous adhesions.
Formaldehyde: Used as a preservative in many cosmetics. It is known to cause eye, nose and throat infections,
coughing, asthma attacks, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, skin rashes, nose bleeds, headaches and dizziness.
Diethanolamine (DEA), Monoethanolamine (MEA): When found in products containing nitrites they can
chemically convert to form nitrosamines which are potentially carcinogenic. They are also known to be skin and eye
irritants. They are readily absorbed through the skin and can accumulate in organs.
Toluene: A very common solvent found in nail enamels, hair spray, hair gel, perfumes and fragrances. It triggers
asthma attacks and can even cause asthma in previously healthy people. It is a neurotoxin (adversely effects the
nervous system) and can cause liver damage and hormonal imbalance.
Aluminium: A metal found in antiperspirants and often suspected of being linked to Alzheimer’s disease. As a
neurotoxin it can actively interfere with brain functioning.
Peg Laureth (ethoxylated): This may contain dioxane which is an oestrogen mimic, endocrine disrupter and also
potentially carcinogenic.
Luckily there are natural, alternative sources of personal-care and cosmetic products available on the market. They
can be obtained through companies such as Green People and Young Living (see ‘resources’ section).

Do suntan lotions really work?
Recent scientific studies have revealed that sunscreen lotions may not offer protection from the type of sun damage
that cause skin cancer. Unfortunately, these studies also suggest that sunscreens may actually do more harm than
good and that correct nutrition and sensible exposure time may be all that is needed to stay safe. Sunscreen lotions
may well be effective in protecting the skin from bad sunburn but there are other things going on below the surface
of the skin that could create more serious problems in later years.
Researchers at the UK's Restoration of Appearance and Function Trust found that free radical damage beneath the
surface of the skin was reduced by approximately 50 percent in skin samples treated with sunscreen, compared to
unprotected skin. While that may seem to be effective, researchers determined that the actual "free-radical protection
factor" was only 2. In other words, the sun protection factor of 20+ held true only with ultraviolet B (UVB) rays the rays that cause sunburn. But protection from the free-radical damage that corrupts DNA and may prompt skin
cancer was judged to be insufficient.
Sunscreen use may well help prevent burning but because people feel safer they spend many extra hours in the sun
and the additional hours of exposure may add up to cumulative DNA damage and skin cancer because a
considerable amount of UVA rays are still getting through.
It is important to remember the health benefits of adequate exposure to sunlight, especially in terms of the
manufacture of vitamin D. Those who live in extreme northern and southern latitudes are often vitamin D deficient
because their exposure to sunlight is too low. A lack of vitamin D negatively impacts just about every system in the
body so what we need is balance - the right amount of sun exposure with not too much, and not too little. Sunlight
is not just good for us, it's essential. But excessive exposure leads to sunburn, which is obviously not good for the
skin. Nevertheless, sunburns do serve a purpose; they are nature's way of telling us that we're getting too much sun.
When you start turning red, you're done - your body has had enough sunlight exposure.
Proper nutrition also plays a key role in preventing skin damage. An adequate intake of Vitamins C and E are very
important to relieving stress to the skin and reducing the risk of skin cancer. Folic acid is destroyed rapidly by heat,
cold, and exposure to sunlight. In fact, it is sunlight's destructive effect on folic acid in the skin, not the actual sun
exposure itself that accounts for a significant part of the skin cancer problem. The best dietary sources of folic acid
include spinach and other dark green vegetables, brewers yeast, lima beans, cantaloupe, watermelon and liver from
organically raised animals.
Sunbathing & Sunscreens (excerpt from the Key to Health and Rejuvenation, www.authorhouse.com)
...."The sun is completely harmless unless we expose our bodies to it for unduly long periods of time, especially
between 10am and 3pm (during the summer). Overexposure to sunlight makes most people feel very hot and
bothered and burns their skin. To avoid being burnt and to find relief, our body’s natural instinct urges us to look for
a shady place or to take a cold shower. Sunscreens, however, interfere with our natural response to sunlight.
A British medical report, released in July 1996 and published as the lead article in the prestigious British Medical
Journal, showed that the use of sunscreens might encourage skin cancer because they prompt people to stay in the
sun far too long. Their use can postpone the onset of sunburn by many hours. Most people think that this is
advantageous whereas in fact it puts their lives at risk. The doctors who edited the report cited studies conducted in
1995 in Western Europe and Scandinavia, which showed that frequent users of sunscreen lotion actually suffered
disproportionately higher rates of skin cancer. The report says: “Sunscreens containing only ultraviolet B blocks
protect against sunburn and therefore enable greater exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) than would otherwise be
possible to obtain.” In other words, many sunbathers expose themselves to much more UVA than they would if they
didn’t use screens. Sunburn in fact is the body’s natural defence response against more serious damage such as skin
cancer.

177

Without sunscreen your skin would begin to itch uncomfortably if it was exposed to too much sunlight. However, by
using a sunscreen, you would not notice when your body has had enough of it because your first line of defence -sunburn -- has been crippled. This would lead to overexposure of UVA that together with other internal toxins might
cause skin cancer. Under normal conditions (without sunscreen) you would never get too much UVA even if you
were lying in the sun for five hours. Instead, you would burn your skin heavily through overexposure to UVB.
Although sunburn can impair immune functions and damage the skin, there is no proof that it can cause skin cancer.
The above report stated that medical experts know “little about the precise relation between sunburn and skin
cancer.” This includes the fatal type of skin cancer, the malignant melanoma. Despite the enormous amount of
research done on skin cancers, there has been no indication that malignant melanoma has any links with UV
exposure. But what is known for sure is that sunscreen does not only fail to prevent skin cancer but on the contrary
encourages it by amplifying UVA exposure. This makes sunscreens more dangerous than UV light could ever be.
The question remains whether sunscreens that are made to block out both the UVA and UVB radiation could solve
the problem? Research has shown that they don’t prevent skin cancer either. There are more people suffering from
skin cancer today who have no or only very little exposure to sunlight. Those who live mostly outdoors, at high
altitudes, or near the equator, have the lowest incidence of skin cancers. But those who work under artificial lighting
are the most susceptible.
The average American, for example, spends twenty-two hours a day indoors beneath and around artificial light.
During the winter season most of the working population in the cities never even get to see the daylight, except
through windows that reflect UV light. Incandescent light has a narrow band compared to sunlight and is known to
weaken natural immunity (a Russian study showed that workers who are exposed to UV light during working hours
suffer 50% fewer colds than those who are deprived do). A weak immune system cannot properly defend itself
against disease, and that includes skin cancer!
Researcher Dr. Helen Shaw and her research team conducted a melanoma study at the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, and the Sydney Melanoma Clinic at Sydney Hospital. They found that office workers had
twice the incidence of the deadly cancer as people who work outdoors. The results of the study were published in
1982 by the British medical journal Lancet. Dr. Shaw proved that those who spend most of their time sunbathing
have the lowest risk of developing skin cancer. By contrast, office workers who were exposed to fluorescent light
during most of their working days had the highest risk of developing melanomas. She also discovered that
fluorescent lights cause mutations in cultures of animal cells.
Dr. Shaw’s research lead to the conclusion that both in Australia and Great Britain, melanoma rates were high
among professional and office workers, and low in people working outdoors. In other words, the Australians and
British would be better off spending more time outside where there is plenty of UV light! Similar controlled studies
were conducted at the New York University School of Medicine, which confirmed and substantiated Dr. Shaw’s
research results."
