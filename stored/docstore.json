Ayurveda in the late 1980s and trained as\nAyurvedic Panchakarma Technicians at the Maharishi University of Valkenburg in Holland in 1993. Since\nthat time they have also studied with the renowned Dr Vacant Lad at the Ayurvedic Institute in New\nMexico and Dr David Frawley and Atreya Smith at the American and European Institute of Ayurveda. The\nsubjects they have studied include pulse reading, Ayurvedic herbology, Ayurvedic diet and nutrition and\nMarma therapy. They gave up their careers as Nature Reserve Warden and Photographer respectively and\ndecided to dedicate their lives to passing on this ancient knowledge of rejuvenation and revitalisation to\nothers.\n\nThey have run many centres across the UK and have treated thousands of clients, including many highprofile celebrities and members of the royal family. In their role as both massage therapists and personal\ndevelopment/stress management counsellors they have witnessed extraordinary improvements in the\nquality of life of many of their guests due to the power of the programs they administer.\nPresently they run a very exclusive Panchakarma detox and stress management service in Staffordshire\nwhere they take one client at a time and gently guide them in the Ayurvedic way of living harmoniously\nwith their environment.

They are committed to spreading the knowledge of\nAyurveda and spend much of their time acting as an advice service to both clients and public alike.\n\n\fIntroduction\nThis book has been compiled to provide a practical help guide to those interested in following a healthy\nAyurvedic lifestyle. With complementary therapies and esoteric philosophies becoming much more\nwidely accepted and available in the west many people are interested in finding out more. However,\nwhilst there is a wealth of information in the public domain, there is little in the way of sound, practical\nadvice available to the lay person, especially in the field of Ayurveda. We hope this book will address\nsome of these shortfalls and provide a practical basis for self-improvement.\nAs an all encompassing holistic health-care system, the science of Ayurveda can be viewed as an\numbrella discipline or \u2018mother\u2019 of many modern-day alternative therapies. Having been a successful\nprimary health-care modality for millions of people for many thousands of years it\u2019s translation as \u2018the\nknowledge of life\u2019 is most apt. The oldest written records originate in India and date back over 2000\nyears and its recommendations and advice for healthy living are as relevant today they ever were \u2013 and\nprobably even more so.\nAn important aspect of Ayurveda lies in its ability to understand and describe the subtle energies and\nintelligence flowing through our bodies. Ayurvedic doctors skilled in the ancient practice of pulse reading\nare able to accurately diagnose imbalances in an individual on a mental, physical, emotional and spiritual\nlevel. This allows them to prescribe very effective herbal and behavioural remedies. Unfortunately, as this\nskill is traditionally passed down verbally from one generation of Vaidyas (Ayurvedic doctors) to the\nnext, much of this art has been lost and it is now rarely taught in Ayurvedic collages and universities. It is\nnot a subject we will address in this book but it is well worth finding an Ayurvedic practitioner that is\nskilled in this field if you have severe chronic health problems.\nHowever, the Ayurvedic texts contain a treasure trove of knowledge based on its profound understanding\nof the deeper workings of nature and the rhythms and cycles that govern all life on earth. This knowledge\nis practical, easy to understand and is suitable for anyone interested in improving their physical, mental\nand spiritual health. It is our aim to faithfully present this knowledge in clear, easy-to-follow steps which\nyou can slowly introduce into your life if you have choose to take responsibility for your own health and\nwell-being and are willing to dedicate a little time and effort.\nIn the first chapter you will learn how to ascertain your unique Ayurvedic body-type. You will also learn\nhow to recognise imbalances in your body-type when you stray from your natural way of being and, most\nimportantly, how you can rectify them through diet and lifestyle adaptations. If we insist in following\ninappropriate diets or lifestyles for prolonged periods of time our body begins to malfunction and slowly\nbut surely deteriorates. As toxins build up in the mind and body we become prone to persistent aches and\npains and feelings of unease, anxiety or depression. If these signs and symptoms of \u2018dis-ease\u2019 are left\nunchecked we eventually begin to show signs of premature aging and suffer from more chronic\nconditions. By following the guidelines for your particular body-type or imbalance the immune,\ndigestive, endocrine and nervous system will be gently and naturally brought back into balance and good\nhealth and a calm, focused mind will ensue.\nFirstly you should identify your body-type - the body-type questionnaire will help you do this. A visit to\nan Ayurvedic consultant trained in pulse reading will help ensure a more accurate assessment but as these\nare still few and far between in the west the questionnaire is the next best alternative. Once you have\nascertained your psycho-physiological make-up it is then a simple matter of following the general\nguidelines for your specific doshic make-up (body-type).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29083ec6-5cda-496b-b5d2-1214d7d7c302": {"__data__": {"id_": "29083ec6-5cda-496b-b5d2-1214d7d7c302", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce104acd-88d4-4e9c-84a2-57d32c42fbc7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7d32424b59c77d77f67756eb29a2c76a9dfc608ca302621b17232dba11f9ed2"}, "3": {"node_id": "8686245c-ca5e-4083-992a-2606e313ee39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94d1ed4118f153e7869e7f8128353e9fe1ea32892b53a11b47c3a44bacb4c69f"}}, "hash": "7c741413e866ad2ac9e8b85bac5fd3bbd5cbcd45c21e8c121d5c387970e70ced", "text": "However, you may need to adapt this slightly\n\n\fto take account of the time of year and the imbalances that are present in your physiology. If you\u2019re one\nof the lucky few who are relatively well balanced you\u2019ll probably find you are naturally following some\nof these practices already.\nIt is worth bearing in mind that maintaining good digestion and ensuring a clean, fully-functioning colon\nare the key to physical health, mental well-being, spiritual harmony and the absence of \u2018dis-ease\u2019. Eating\nthe right foods to balance your body-type is the key to proper digestion. Different body-types require\nvery different foods but once you know your Ayurvedic body-type you can tailor the foods you eat on a\nregular basis to help keep the mind and body functioning properly and operating in perfect balance. The\nkey is moderation and maintaining an adequate supply of the foods that are good for you and reducing\nthose that aren\u2019t so good. Also, the secret of attaining your perfect weight isn\u2019t necessarily totally\ndependant on regulating the amount you eat or the number of calories you consume, but more often the\nchoice of foods you eat, the times at which they are eaten and the manner in which they are eaten.\nIn chapter two we introduce you to the natural cycles of nature and describe methods that can be utilised\nfor to keep your physiology in alignment with these ever-changing patterns of energy. Although we can\u2019t\nsee these energy cycles we can feel their varying \u2018flavours\u2019 as day turns to night or summer turns to\nwinter. We can also witness the unpleasant effects of falling out of alignment with these cycles but,\nconversely, can also enjoy the pleasure of keeping in tune with the rhythm of these energy flows. The\nexercise and yoga routines will keep the body supple and free of toxins, while the breathing exercises and\nmeditation will help balance the mind. A balanced mind creates calmness, health and vitality.\nLifestyle and behaviour play another key role in maintaining balance and harmony in your mind and body\nand again different body-types require slightly different approaches. However, the exercise and yoga\nroutines we\u2019ve included in this book can be followed by just about anyone and will have a beneficial\neffect on the health and wellbeing of everyone who is motivated to putting in a little practice each day.\nYou should consult your GP before undertaking any physical exercise if you have, or have had, any\nmedical problems or feel unwell or unfit. As yoga is very popular nowadays it should be relatively easy\nto find a competent Yoga instructor in your local area who can advise you further and tailor your practice\nto suit your level of health, suppleness and fitness. However, always remember that yoga is not about\npushing, straining and contorting the body un-naturally \u2013 each posture should be eased into slowly,\ngracefully and gently, leaving the body feeling refreshed and invigorated \u2013 not worn out and aching. The\nadage, \u2018no pain, no gain\u2019 has no place in the Ayurvedic Yoga system.\nFollowing our instructions for balancing the breath (pranayama) and settling the mind (meditation) are\npowerful ways to begin to experience profound levels of inner peace and harmony in a very short space of\ntime. These techniques are now widely accepted as scientifically valid ways to improve health and reduce\nstress on a deep psychological level. Many large corporations, especially in the USA and Japan, have\ntrained their key staff in these skills to help them cope with the ever-increasing pressures of the modernday work environment whilst also improving their competitive edge and resourcefulness. Of course there\nare side-effects \u2013 reduced weight, stronger digestion, increased immunity and a peaceful, relaxed mind.\nIn chapter three we introduce the concept of \u2018the detox\u2019. From an Ayurvedic standpoint the digestive\ntract is often the primary source of illness and keeping it balanced and fully-functioning is of utmost\nimportance. Eating the right foods for your body-type with reference to the seasons is the first place to\nstart. However, especially in the west and especially in today\u2019s fast-paced society, getting adequate\nnutrition at the right time of day and in the right environment can be very difficult. To compound this,\nthe food we eat is often refined, processed and lacking in the essential nutrients we need to maintain, let\nalone improve, our bodies.

Detox programs are best\ndone under the supervision of a qualified nutritionist but there is no harm in trying them yourself as long\nas you stop as soon as you begin to experience any unpleasant \u2018detoxing symptoms\u2019 (headaches, nausea\netc).\nWe\u2019ve also included an overview of some of the therapies that may be administered during Panchakarma\n(an Ayurveda detox program). Ayurveda employs a wide range of powerful massage techniques to help\nrectify imbalances within the physiology, many involving two technicians working in harmony on either\nside of the body. Most Ayurvedic massages are luxuriously relaxing, to soothe the body and calm the\nmind, while others are more stimulating, to energise the body and mobilise impurities. Treatment plans\nare usually individually tailored, so whether you need to relax the mind or purify and revitalise the whole\nbody a suitable treatment package will be prescribed to help bring the body back into balance.

This section\nwill also help you understand the benefits of improving your digestion and keeping your bowels cleansed\nand healthy for optimum assimilation of nutrients.\nAs well as herbal oil massages, Panchakarma detox programs also utilise bastis; herbal oil enemas, which\nscientific studies have shown to increase the effective elimination of impurities by up to sixty percent.\nThey are an essential component if you wish to lose weight, improve complexion or remove longstanding aches and pains from the muscles and joints. If you desire a flatter belly and a healthy glow\nthese are the key to success.\nChapter four contains a glossary of both Ayurvedic and western terminology used to describe the\nproperties of herb and essential oils. It also includes a list of herbal formulas and the conditions they can\nbe used for. Chapter five is dedicated to practical therapies and techniques you can do at home. There is\ninformation on nasal cleansing, to unblock the sinuses, and advise on how to cope with allergies. There is\nalso information on joint problems and how they can be rectified, as well as some valuable information\nand remedies for female related problems.\nChapter six gives practical advice for balancing the mind and resolving emotional conflicts. We\u2019ve also\nincluded a section on Thought Field Therapy , a powerful technique developed by Dr. Roger Challahan, a\nclinical psychologist from the USA. By utilising this technique you can learn how to \u2018tap\u2019 some powerful\nmeridian points that can relieve some of life\u2019s most stubborn obstacles to growth and development such\nas phobias and fears.\nWe have included a chapter on mantra chanting for you to experiment with. Many of our clients have had\nextraordinary results by introducing some of these mantras into their daily lives. We have also included a\nsection of our favourite recipes to give you some idea of the types of meals you can prepare using\nayurvedic principles. Each recipe provides a foundation on which you can experiment and adapt to your\nown particular tastes. Many are these recipes are tri-doshic and therefore suitable for all body-types;\nespecially with the addition of churnas (herb and spice combinations).\nFinally, we\u2019ve included a selection of famous quotes and saying in which we hope you\u2019ll find elements of\ntruth or inspiration relative to your own life path.

Tick any attributes, abilities, conditions and states of mind or afflictions\nthat apply to you. If you are unsure about any of the questions you may wish to consult a friend who\nknows you well and can perhaps be more objective. In reality the questionnaire is more likely to reveal\nthe particular doshas that are out of balance within your physiology. This is especially so if the bottom\nhalf of the Vata, Pitta or Kapha questionnaire pages are ticked in preference to, or as well as, the top half.\nFor a more thorough understanding or your body-type it is best to consult an Ayurvedic practitioner who\nwill also read your pulse.\nThe questionnaire will also help you understand the traits and physical and mental characteristics of each\nbody-type. Each of us has a unique body-type, usually with one type (dosha) very prominent and one\nclose behind. Thus, a person with many Vata traits (lots of boxes ticked), fewer Pitta traits (less boxes\nticked) and very few Kapha traits (few boxes ticked) would be deemed a Vata/Pitta body-type. In this\nexample it could also be that the Vata traits show up mainly in the physical characteristics of the person\n(right side of page) and the Pitta traits show up mainly in the mental or emotion side of the person (left\nside of page). Each and every one of us has characterises of all three doshas in our physiology but one or\ntwo of the doshas usually show up more predominantly.\nVata is composed of the elements of ether and air and governs the principle of movement and\ncommunication in our physiology. Pitta is composed of the elements of fire and water and governs the\nprinciple of energy and transformation in our physiology. It allows us to digest, absorb and assimilate\nfood, liquid and ideas. Kapha is composed of the elements of water and earth and governs the principle of\ncohesion or structure. It is the \u2018glue\u2019 that holds or binds our physiology together.\nIt is our unique combination and percentage of each dosha; vata, pitta and kapha, that governs how we\ninteract with the rest of the relative universe. Our unique body-type gives us absolute individuality and\nonce we intimately understand, not only our own but other peoples, body-types we naturally behave more\ntolerantly and become more gentle, more forgiving and less critical both of ourselves and others. With\nthis understanding comes not only the will and courage to adapt to our own strengths and weaknesses but\nthe ability to keep them in balance and functioning optimally.\nOnce you have filled in the body-type questionnaire and ascertained your unique Ayurvedic body-type\nyou can then follow the recommendations that follow to help stay balanced and healthy. If you have\nticked many of the boxes on the lower part of the vata, pitta or kapha questionnaire pages this indicates an\nimbalance in that particular dosha. Even if this is not your predominant dosha (most ticks) you should\nnevertheless balance this dosha first by following the recommendations for balancing that dosha.", "start_char_idx": null,

Pitta & Kapha\nVata, pitta and Kapha are known as doshas in Ayurveda; they are the underlying principles that govern\nthe nature, transformation and structure of the physical universe. Each dosha is composed of two of the\nfive elements (ether, air, fire, water and earth) and it is the specific combination of these elements that\ndetermines each doshas characteristic qualities and ultimately their overall effect in nature. Every object\nin the natural world is composed of the elements of vata, pitta and kapha and it is the relative proportion\nof each dosha or element that determines its uniqueness and differentiates it from another objects.\nVata is composed of the elements of air and space and its qualities are light, subtle, moving, cold, dry,\nhard and rough. Vata governs movement in the mind and body. Pitta is composed of the elements of fire\nand water and its qualities are hot, acidic, sour and sharp. Pitta governs transformation in the mind and\nbody, whether it\u2019s the digestion, assimilation and metabolism of food and water into energy or the\ndigestion and assimilation of thoughts and ideas into actions. Kapha is composed of the elements of\nearth and water and its qualities are heavy, cold, slow, binding, sticky and smooth. Kapha is responsible\nfor the density and structure of our body.\nA person with a predominance of Vata dosha walks more quickly, has a lighter build and has colder and\ndryer skin than someone with a predominance of Pitta or Kapha dosha in their constitution. Vata-type\npeople also tend to have very quick, agile minds and can be very creative. However, if their constitution\ngoes out of balance through excessive movement or irregularity they can suffer from feelings of\nrestlessness, boredom, fear, stress and anxiety. This may manifest in the body as poor circulation, cold\nhands and feet, constipation and dry skin.\nA person with more Pitta in their constitution has a hotter, fierier, more dynamic personality. They have\nlots of energy, high ambitions, sharp intellects and good leadership qualities. However, if they go out of\nbalance and their innate \u2018fire\u2019 becomes too high they can quickly become angry, stressed and frustrated.\nThey generally have a strong digestive fire and immune system but when they slip out of balance they can\ndevelop rashes, ulcers, acid stomachs and heart problems.\nA person with a predominance of Kapha dosha in their constitution is generally slower, heavier, calmer\nand more grounded than either Pitta or Vata. They are caring, loving, forgiving individuals with a placid,\neasy-going nature. They have strong, solid bodies but can suffer from weight gain, lethargy and heaviness\nwhen they are out of balance.\nWith an understanding of the qualities inherent in the elements that combine to make up the three doshas\nwe are able to keep the doshas in balance in our own bodies and thereby remain healthy, happy and free\nfrom dis-ease. Any excessive increase in any of the qualities present in our doshic make-up will tend to\naggravate that dosha and will lead to imbalance. To decrease a quality we need to increase its opposite\nquality. Thus, is we are a predominantly Vata body-type and we become excessively cold or are exposed\nto noisy, busy environments with excess movement we will soon become imbalanced and un-grounded.\nIf we immediately introduce the opposite qualities of warmth or calmness and quietness we will soon\nbring ourselves back into a grounded, more balanced state. Similarly, for a Pitta person, who has a\npredominance of heat, the opposing quality of coldness will bring them back into balance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1f7dc1a-fcc4-4162-b1a5-79498483498a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1f7dc1a-fcc4-4162-b1a5-79498483498a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bc20a91-97de-439f-b610-b274a00416ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d358dc6ef85e3b2f117a85da59805c873e58cec4c625407a08a64ac7b04c910d"}, "3": {"node_id": "0597f409-1e2a-4768-bcc5-e44b305b1b9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "818430c39f2e01f238e8ef8c87fd54e42408f022f48b65d80e2aa2ceec2004da"}}, "hash": "cd8366cfa7e462b2e8ebe0b0465aea0b070cc73055f80506ed7fde0d3c1f1170", "text": "A Kapha\nperson, who has a predominance of heaviness, will be balanced by the opposing quality of lightness.\nI hope the next piece \u2018The dosha family go shopping\u2019 will help you to understand how extreme Vata, Pitta\nand Kapha body-type people conduct their lives!\n\n6\n\n\fThe Dosha family go shopping\nCharacters: Mr Kapha Dosha, Mrs Pitta Dosha, Master Vata Dosha\nIt\u2019s a lovely sunny morning in the beautiful village of Toadbury where the Dosha family are beginning to\ngo about their daily business. Mr Kapha Dosha has volunteered to do the shopping whilst Mrs Pitta Dosha\ntidies the house ready for the arrival of their friends later that day. Master Vata Dosha isn\u2019t quite sure\nwhat he\u2019s going to do on this particular day but he\u2019s rather tired as he\u2019s spent most of the night worrying\nabout the gig he\u2019s managed to pull off at the Three Shires Inn later that evening. He\u2019s busy tuning his\nguitar but his mind just won\u2019t settle and he\u2019s afraid that his debut at this important venue will be a\ncomplete flop.\nIn typical Kapha fashion Mr Dosha has woken late again and is still eating his breakfast at 10am. He\nlistens patiently to his wife as she rapidly reels off the shopping list \u2013 he\u2019s a little distracted by their cat,\nPretty Polly, who\u2019s in the garden trying to stalk a beady-eyed Blackbird. However, he nods politely and is\nthankful she\u2019s written it all down as usual. He agrees to be back by 11\u2019o\u2019 clock at the latest but hasn\u2019t any\nidea what the time is anyway as he\u2019s misplaced his watch again for the fourth time in a week. As he steps\nout of the house he\u2019s pleasantly amused by the duelling duo again \u2013 the cat is now looking rather angry\nand slightly embarrassed as the Blackbird she\u2019s just attempted to pounce upon has decided to put an end\nto the silly game. She\u2019d cautiously manoeuvred into her final approach and was all ready to pounce,\nconfident of a delicious reward. However, the Blackbird was keenly aware of the cat\u2019s presence and at the\nlast moment had nonchalantly flown to the top of the garage roof, sung a melodious wee tune and then\nswooped so low over Pretty Polly that she has to duck for cover and almost fell in the goldfish pond in the\nprocess.\nMr Kapha laughs heartily and takes a seat by the garden shed to lap up some of the morning sun. He\nlistens to the Robins and Linnets, gazes at the Swallows and Swifts catching flies above him and sighs\ndeeply as aromas from the honey-scented roses gently drift over on the light, warm breeze. He feels a\ndeep gratitude and contentment and gradually dozes off in the sun blissfully unaware of his angry wife\napproaching. She strides purposefully towards him, her ginger hair flowing wildly behind her. He wakes\nabruptly, senses the urgency in her angry reproach as he remembers his shopping duty and makes his way\nto the car. He settles into the car seat, adjusting it slightly to accommodate his somewhat corpulent build,\nputs on some music and slowly backs the car into the street. As he lazily makes his way to the shops his\nmind is still in the garden, soaking up the sun and smelling the fresh roses. He finds a convenient parking\nspace, realises he\u2019s forgotten the shopping list and strolls to the precinct via his favourite park with the\nlarge pink and red Rhododendrons and majestic Cedar trees.\nHe can\u2019t resist the sweet, homely smells of the bakery and stops off to buy some doughnuts. He ambles\ninto the supermarket and is immediately tempted by the fascinating array of meats and cheeses at the deli\ncounter. He chooses a few and tries to remember what Mrs Pitta Dosha had on her shopping list. He\nwishes he\u2019d remembered it \u2013 she\u2019d typed it out very neatly and even arranged it in order of the rows in the\nstore. However, he does the best he can and makes his way home laden with all manner of \u2018goodies\u2019 he\nfeels will please his guests.\nHis wife has finished all the housework in record time and has even tidied his office and trimmed the\nbushes in the front garden.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0597f409-1e2a-4768-bcc5-e44b305b1b9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0597f409-1e2a-4768-bcc5-e44b305b1b9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1f7dc1a-fcc4-4162-b1a5-79498483498a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd8366cfa7e462b2e8ebe0b0465aea0b070cc73055f80506ed7fde0d3c1f1170"}, "3": {"node_id": "ebfb7f73-ac3e-49a6-a74f-3484b0b15f2c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fb1e578a325335d7755e4fae37f8b1ed8689dcfeadf5b359785bc8f68f1add4"}}, "hash": "818430c39f2e01f238e8ef8c87fd54e42408f022f48b65d80e2aa2ceec2004da", "text": "However, she\u2019s none too pleased at his late return and can\u2019t imagine why on\nearth it\u2019s taken three hours to do a tiny bit of shopping and how in the Lord\u2019s name he could lose the car\nin such a small town. On finding he\u2019s forgotten to buy almost half the groceries on her list she flies off\n\n7\n\n\finto a rage again and slams the door so hard that even the windows in the garden shed rattle a little. She\nscreeches tyres as she zooms out onto the street and is at the shops in ten minutes flat. She parks neatly\nnear the entrance of the supermarket, clears sweet packets and chocolate wrappers out of the car into a\nnearby rubbish-bin and hurries to the isles. She methodically marches down one isle after another, rapidly\nticking off all the items on her list. She jumps the queue at the fast checkout, packs the food in the boot of\nthe car and charges off to the printers to collect some business cards she ordered several weeks before. On\nher way home she gets the car washed at the local garage, selects some choice flowers to brighten the\nliving room from the tree nursery and calls in at the hairdressers to check her appointment for later that\nday. She\u2019s home within an hour and quickly unpacks the car before making a quick salad for lunch.\nMeanwhile Master Vata Dosha has been searching his chaotic room for the song sheets he\u2019s been\nworking on for weeks. He finally finds it half-hidden, torn and crumbled under a tee-shirt amongst all the\ndirty jeans and piles of books by the bathroom door. He\u2019s still undecided as to the most appropriate order\nof play and is completely at a loss regarding whether or not to start with his own song. He\u2019s been told\nrepeatedly that it\u2019s very good but he thinks that perhaps another song \u2013 one that everybody will almost\ncertainly love and be able to identify with would be better. In the frantic flurry of searching he\u2019s managed\nto knock over his guitar and broken a couple of strings which has stressed him even further as he\u2019s\nforgotten to buy any spares.\nHe asks his Dad if he can borrow the car, half hears the answer and rushes out of the front door. He jumps\nin the car, knocks the side mirror in passing and then realises he hasn\u2019t got any car-keys. He grabs them\nfrom the sideboard and hurries out of the house again and then almost runs over the cat as he backs the\ncar out of the driveway. Finally, he stalls the engine as he hits the kerbs on the other side of the road. His\nerratic driving warrants the attention of a few rather more cautious drivers and their \u2018honking\u2019 and handsignals agitates him even further.\nOnce in town he parks haphazardly near the music store and forgets to lock the car. Once in the shop he\ngrabs the guitar strings he needs and then quickly dashes back to the car for his wallet. He fiddles with the\nremote key fob and is more than a little confused when he finds the car is now locked but presses the\nremote control once again and unlocks it. In his haste he bangs the car mirror back into place but scuffs\nhis new suede shoes on the kerb as he narrowly misses knocking over a postman.\nOn his way home he realises he\u2019s forgotten to pick up the hair gel he\u2019d intended to buy and turns the car\nround. His usual supplier is completely out so he\u2019s heads to the next village which is also where his friend\nJoe lives. After picking up some gel and shampoo he heads to Joe\u2019s but then realises Joe needs the song\nsheets which are back at home. He turns round and heads home only to realise that he\u2019s almost out of fuel\nand needs to make a detour to find a garage. He finally arrives home; flies upstairs, grabs the song-sheets\nand heads back to Joe\u2019s. Joe\u2019s not in and he\u2019s forgotten to bring his mobile and as Joe\u2019s number is on the\nmobile he has no way of finding out where he is. He decides to drive home again and try again later. As\nhe pulls into the driveway he recognises Joe\u2019s car and suddenly remembers he had arranged to meet him\nat 2pm. He scratches the door of his Dad\u2019s car on the wall as he gets out and apologises profusely to his\nfriend for being late.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebfb7f73-ac3e-49a6-a74f-3484b0b15f2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebfb7f73-ac3e-49a6-a74f-3484b0b15f2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "0597f409-1e2a-4768-bcc5-e44b305b1b9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "818430c39f2e01f238e8ef8c87fd54e42408f022f48b65d80e2aa2ceec2004da"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9ae06a9-f479-4516-bbad-e092de523eb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a32c2221c94dc18acb92ba3a7e7b8505c4c50352cea7de61558f24461119df82"}}, "hash": "6fb1e578a325335d7755e4fae37f8b1ed8689dcfeadf5b359785bc8f68f1add4", "text": "Joe has brought a new tape and it plays soothingly in the background, his mother has made him his\nfavourite cup of Chamomile tea and his father has finally got round to typing out his song sheets and\ndetermined the right order of play.

Its primary function is transformation and is the force of\nmetabolic activity in the body associated with the endocrine function, digestion, body temperature, visual\nperception, hunger, thirst, and skin quality. In Western terms we can categorise the activities of pitta in terms of\namino acids, enzymes, bile, hydrochloric acid and hormones. This explains the seemingly contradictory\ncombination of fire and water to form pitta. Pitta exists as water or oil in the body, thus preserving the tissues\nfrom the destructive aspect of fire. It resides in the eyes, blood, sweat glands and lymph but its primary site is in\nthe small intestine. Mentally it plays a role in understanding, in digesting sensory impressions.\nYou need to balance the heat of pitta if many of the following conditions are present:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nYour skin is overly oily and prone to acne.\nYou are prone to rashes, fevers or inflammatory skin conditions\nYou have excessive hunger or thirst.\nYou sweat profusely and have overly hot hands and feet.\nYou suffer from infections, access acidity, ulcers and heart problems.\nYou are overly aggressive and prone to anger and frustration.\nYou experience lose or hot, watery stools and diarrhoea-type elimination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fed19725-f06a-4b62-8b2a-67cddb5a1623": {"__data__": {"id_": "fed19725-f06a-4b62-8b2a-67cddb5a1623", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9ae06a9-f479-4516-bbad-e092de523eb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a32c2221c94dc18acb92ba3a7e7b8505c4c50352cea7de61558f24461119df82"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cd7b4c3-6097-4e70-aa18-e03d24b33dda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "830f7fa6f8bd20aa3b3ab4c46b8eef4ca3a565fb8d3f1083fb8814de3c635645"}}, "hash": "0fcc629574c9e9ee811aaa5d9fcd308f1c17e05d5715e9be198b6b3a046481bb", "text": "You experience lose or hot, watery stools and diarrhoea-type elimination.\nYou tend to be overly critical, domineering, obsessive or controlling in nature.\nYou experience frequent eyestrain or tension headaches.\nYou are going prematurely grey or balding.\n\nTips for balancing Pitta:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nFollow a Pitta balancing diet and avoid overly hot, spicy or sour foods.\nAvoid very heating substances such as red meat, alcohol and tobacco.\nAvoid excessive fasting and try to eat when you are hungry.

The key factor is to balance digestion as this will help to reduce cravings and normalise appetite.\nA Kapha-related weight imbalance is due to a lack of digestive fire (low agni) and low metabolic rate so even\nthough we may eat very small amounts of food, we still tend to gain weight. With this type of imbalance\ndigestive impurities are being created, fat tissue is accumulating in the body and the formation of bone tissue is\nslowed down due to accumulation of fat tissue. The solution is to increase the metabolic rate and burn up the\nimpurities.\nWhen excess weight accumulates, it blocks nutrient circulation and can aggravate Pitta. This results in excess\nacid, excess thirst, irritability and an intense appetite for sweet, heavy, cooling foods \u2014 the very kind of foods\nthat cause us to gain weight to begin with. The solution is to drink herbalised water containing small amounts of\nfenugreek, coriander and fennel throughout the day. Fenugreek burns fat and helps absorption, coriander\neliminates toxins, and fennel helps with digestion.

If the body receives all these tastes in each\nmeal it feels satisfied and will not overeat or feel hungry again soon after eating. However, there are far more\ntaste buds that register the sweet as opposed to astringent or sour taste. This is because we do not require equal\namounts of each taste. There are more \u2018sweet\u2019 taste buds because this is the taste we require the most of; sweet\ntasting foods, such as rice and milk, are nourishing and give us protein, energy and vitality. They are heavy and\ngrounding and are required by Vata types much more than Kapha types.\nBitter tasting foods supply many vitamins, enzymes and minerals. They are also detoxifying, reduce water\nretention and are good as tonics for the liver and blood. Most are cleansing and help take away burning and\nitching sensations. In excess they can aggravate vata and dehydrate the body. Astringent tasting foods are also\ndiuretic and blood purifiers. They help balance pitta and kapha but in excess can create gas and constipation.\nSpices are certainly a quick, convenient and flavourful way of incorporating the more unusual bitter and\nastringent tastes. Salt helps the body retain water and maintains substance and grounding, whilst pungent and\nsour tasting foods burn up toxins and stimulate the digestion.\nAs different body-types require different quantities of each taste we must allow our own innate intelligence to\ndetermine what combinations it requires in terms of optimum nutrition, especially since this may change on a\ndaily and/or seasonal basis. Our limited modern model of nutrition is continually being updated and adapted as\nwe discover new groups of molecules (such as vitamins, minerals enzymes and proteins) that our body requires\nto function optimally. It then struggles to determine the appropriate amount of each vitamin, mineral, enzyme or\nprotein our bodies require and in what combinations they should be taken in. The debate will probably go on\nforever as there are so many variables to consider. However, Ayurveda has a simple solution \u2013 simply accept\nthat our own body knows intuitively and instinctively just what it needs at any particular moment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4e5fa1a-8b97-4618-972e-1d3d6c68c5a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4e5fa1a-8b97-4618-972e-1d3d6c68c5a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "53d4ba3f-2388-43d1-a9c5-cf4fad109258", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5407dfa582d51b895b0b66d317d698bde2d6ee9b7400588d9adeeb94534825f"}, "3": {"node_id": "546db833-2932-4060-b79a-61b7add4887a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "15cbd3eb6b059f807e73d6425adf39e2b79bfcff0f68ca6f500210f42e1ac95c"}}, "hash": "7d236d737f037d286ff572e9ab28d0f685b6b018cee6a72676cf7a0b1bd2d244", "text": "It relays its\nmessage through our desire for particular taste combinations and we should follow those impulses for maximum\nhealth. Of course, to be sure that these signals are getting through we need to remain relaxed, balanced and fully\naware. The life-style recommendations in this book are designed to facilitate this process.\nTo summarise: the only effective way to reduce the amount of food you eat and to cut down on unhealthy\ncravings is to include all six tastes in every meal. Furthermore, these six tastes are not required in equal amounts\nbut should be combined in proportions to suit your particular body type.\nVata body-types: Generally require more sweet, sour and salty tastes especially in winter or if stressed. Meals\nshould also be heavy, warm, oily and nourishing (soups and stews are good).\nPitta body-types: Generally require more sweet, bitter and astringent tastes especially in summer. Food should\nalso be slightly heavy and oily and small cold dishes may be included.\nKapha body-types: Generally require more bitter, astringent and pungent tastes, especially in spring or if feeling\nheavy, lethargic or dull minded. Food should also be light, dry and warm to aid digestion and heavy, oily foods\nand dairy products should be excluded.\n\n17\n\n\fImproving digestion & maintaining health\nIn the west the majority of people suffer from everyday digestion problems such as gas, bloating,\nstomach pain, constipation, heartburn, and fatigue after eating. Ayurveda provides simple solutions to\nthese common complaints by considering not only what we eat but how we consume our meals.\nTo ensure food is properly digested, assimilated and metabolised by the body it is important to follow\nthese guidelines:\n\u2022\n\nEat at the times when the body has the necessary enzymes available to cope with the digestion of food.\nThe peak time for enzymatic production is mid-day and this is the time to eat the largest meal of the\nday. By ensuring that the heaviest foods and largest quantities are eaten at this time, the bodily tissues\nare able to fully utilise the nutritional value of foods consumed. This helps reduce the amount of food\nrequired by the body and reduces food cravings between meals. It also goes a long way to helping\nreduce weight and maintaining hormone balance. The evening meal should be light as the body\nproduces far less enzymes to help digest food at this period of the day. You should aim to eat at least\nthree hours before going to bed and this should therefore be between 5-7pm.\nHave you ever gone out for a late dinner and found that it was a strain to wake up the next morning or\nthat it was difficult to be efficient during the following day? These are often the side effects of\nimproperly digested food. The best way to avoid these problems is to follow nature's prescription of\nsuitable times to eat. When the sun is strongest the digestive fire is also strongest. Agni is associated\nwith the Sun. This is one of the ways ayurveda seeks to connect our mind and body with the\nenvironment. As the sun goes down so does our agni. Late night meals interfere with sleep and after\n10:00 p.m. the body is working to burn off toxins and continue to digest food from the day. If you eat\nafter 10:00 p.m., the food may cause toxins to accumulate in the system, and as a result the next day\nyou wake up tired. If you are not able to wake up fresh and clear, then it is important to analyze the\nquantity of food and the time of night you are eating dinner.\n\n\u2022\n\nEach meal should be taken in a peaceful, pleasant environment and should not be consumed when\nirritated, angry or stressed as this hinders the digestive process and leads to bloating, gas and the buildup of toxins in the gut. Excessive talk or a noisy environment hinders the digestion and leads to\nundigested food remaining in the body causing wind and bloating. Watching television or reading\nduring eating can also have similar effects. Our bodies need an uplifting and settled environment in\norder to process and absorb the nutrients from our meals. If that is not available then we should at least\nbe sitting down to eat - not standing, walking or driving. The act of eating is life-giving. The process of\neating, according to ayurveda, is something reverent and important for the development of\nconsciousness as well as our physical health. When we sit down to eat our stomach is in a relaxed\nposture and our awareness is on the taste, texture, and smell of the food.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "546db833-2932-4060-b79a-61b7add4887a": {"__data__": {"id_": "546db833-2932-4060-b79a-61b7add4887a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4e5fa1a-8b97-4618-972e-1d3d6c68c5a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d236d737f037d286ff572e9ab28d0f685b6b018cee6a72676cf7a0b1bd2d244"}, "3": {"node_id": "b810c660-770e-4379-992d-0f52be81a80c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e702a869a3d7f6bd56fe4b59045bac0386ac523f2840efde6424c4e4d44810c"}}, "hash": "15cbd3eb6b059f807e73d6425adf39e2b79bfcff0f68ca6f500210f42e1ac95c", "text": "This will greatly improve the\ndigestion.\n\n\u2022\n\nWhilst it is important to drink between 1-2 litres of water per day, liquid should not be consumed half\nan hour before or one hour after eating as this ensures that the digestive enzymes responsible for\ndigesting food aren\u2019t diluted by excessive water intake. It is, however, useful to sip small amounts of\nhot water with a meal as this aids the digestive process. Ayurveda recommends taking a small cup of\n\u2018Post-digestive\u2019 tea (see \u2018herbal teas\u2019) to help with the digestive process. Hot water with fresh ginger,\nlemon, fennel seeds or mint leaves should be sipped throughout the day.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe next ayurvedic recommendation also addresses agni. Ayurveda recommends avoiding cold drinks\nat meals and ice cold foods in general. This is like putting cold water on the burning logs. Iced water,\n\n18\n\n\fnormally served at restaurants, extinguishes the digestive fire. Even juice or milk right out of the\nrefrigerator is too cold for the digestion. Juice should be taken at room temperature and water without\nice. Once you get into this habit of drinking beverages at room temperature you will notice a dramatic\nimprovement in your digestion and the way your body feels while eating and after the meal. Cold drinks\nand foods mixed with warm cooked foods can cause stomach cramps, bloating and general discomfort\nin the stomach area. If you have a pitta imbalance you can take cool drinks in-between meals. Cold or\nfrozen foods are not recommended for pitta either because even though they may temporarily cool\ndown the heat, the agni is still being over stimulated and the imbalance will continue. Try slightly cool\ndrinks made with rose water, or milk blended with dates or fresh mangos.\n\u2022\n\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol and carbonated soft drinks and switch to life-giving, vitality-boosting\nbeverages. Water, that most basic yet most overlooked elixir of life, helps to rehydrate the system and\nflushes toxins from the body. Water that has been boiled and cooled has the added healing element of\nfire in it. Adding herbs and spices suited to your physiology or designed to correct a specific imbalance\ncan enhance the healing quality of the water you drink. At bedtime, drink a cup of warm milk (boil and\ncool it for added digestibility) blended with a spoonful of ghee, a pinch of ginger, a pinch of cardamom\nand a pinch of nutmeg will aid sleep.\n\n\u2022\n\nCut down on sugar, wheat, coffee, tea, alcohol and red meat as these hinder the digestive process, leach\nnutrients and water from the body or block the uptake of nutrients from food. This is especially so with\nsugar as this \u2018feeds\u2019 the \u2018bad\u2019 bacteria in the gut and helps them multiply \u2013 this leads to candida,\nbloating, wind and indigestion.\n\n\u2022\n\nAnother way to improve the digestion is to stimulate the agni or digestive fire before we begin eating.\nWeak digestive agni may result in fatigue after eating so Ayurveda recommends eating a one inch piece\nof fresh ginger with a few drops of lemon juice and a few pinches of salt on it before a full meal. This\nstarts to activate the salivary glands, producing the necessary enzymes so that the nutrients in the food\nare easily absorbed by the body. See \u2018Ginger Pickle\u2019 recipe.\nBalancing your digestive agni is a key principle in Ayurvedic medicine. That's why ayurveda\nrecommends a number of general practices for better digestion. Digestive agni can be compared to a\nburning fire. If the flame is very low than it will take a long time to cook the food. In the same way if\nthe fire is too big it can burn the food. If we put a huge log on a low fire it will extinguish it. Our\ndigestive fires should be balanced so that we can digest our meals efficiently and smoothly.\n\n\u2022\n\nIdeally, each main meal should provide the six tastes of bitter, sweet, pungent, astringent, sour and\nsalty. This ensures the nutritional requirements of the body are met and reduces the need for snacking\nand over-eating. Specific mixtures of herbs or \u2018churna\u2019s\u2019 may be added during cooking or sprinkled\nover food to ensure a balance of the six tastes in each meal (see \u2018churna\u2019 recipes).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b810c660-770e-4379-992d-0f52be81a80c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b810c660-770e-4379-992d-0f52be81a80c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "546db833-2932-4060-b79a-61b7add4887a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "15cbd3eb6b059f807e73d6425adf39e2b79bfcff0f68ca6f500210f42e1ac95c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4742ce5f-71eb-4fd5-81ea-ed11db97d4ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "253ffc23f6516839e0ffd23eb24de0dc3f562640c449db478eee66dfa3a47023"}}, "hash": "0e702a869a3d7f6bd56fe4b59045bac0386ac523f2840efde6424c4e4d44810c", "text": "Spices not only add\nflavour and aroma; they also bring therapeutic value to the meal. They help boost natural immunity, and\nmost of them boost the digestion so that the body is better able to absorb and assimilate the nutrients\nfrom the foods you eat.\n\n\u2022\n\nStart the day with a stewed apple and raisins as this is light, warm and nourishing and breaks the fast of\nthe night slowly. The digestive system needs warm, nourishing foods in the morning to stimulate it, but\nnot too much. The digestive fire is just waking up, and will be at full capacity when the sun is high in\nthe sky, at noon. Heavier proteins and larger amounts of food are best digested later in the day. A\nstewed apple also helps your elimination system, because it is easy to digest and contains lots of fibre.\nIt also contains vitamins, trace minerals, and antioxidants. This is also a good recommendation for\nweight loss as anything that is light on the digestion, and adds nutrients rather than empty calories,\nhelps burn body fat.\n\n19\n\n\f\u2022\n\nIt is important not to eat if there is no hunger/appetite present. Often the feeling of \u2018needing something\u2019\nto eat is really a need for liquid intake \u2013 try and listen to the body\u2019s signals. Often the body needs\nsmaller, easily digestible soups and fruit/vegetable juices rather than a \u2018full-blown\u2019 meal, to gain energy\nand vitality.\n\n\u2022\n\nEat slowly and always chew your food well - many digestive enzymes are added from the salivary\nglands and these are stimulated by the action of the jaw. Food that enters the stomach should be \u2018soup\nlike\u2019 as the stomach has no teeth to do this for you.\n\n\u2022\n\nAt the end of a meal it is beneficial to wait for five minutes before taking seconds or a desert as this\ngives the body time to register fullness and to indicate whether it requires more. You should leave the\ntable feeling light, refreshed and energetic. It you feel heavy and tired after eating this is an indication\nthat you have eaten too much or that the food you ate was nutritionally poor. Allow five to ten minutes\nbefore leaving the table and then take a short walk for ten to fifteen minutes to aid the digestive process.\n\n\u2022\n\nFood consumed should always be of the highest quality. Fresh, organic food is best and all refined,\nprocessed food is best avoided. Colour, taste and presentation are as important as nutritional content as\nthe pleasure we get from smelling, seeing and tasting food determines the abundance of enzymes\nnecessary for proper digestion.\n\n\u2022\n\nIf raw foods are eaten these should be taken at the beginning of the meal and always in small quantities\n(less than one third of the total meal content). Whilst raw food contains an abundance of vitamins and\nenzymes the body finds it harder to break these down than cooked food and this can lead to severe\ndigestive problems, especially if the body is already under stress and the digestion is working less than\noptimally. The best cooking method is to lightly steam vegetables as this ensures minimal loss of\nenzymes and maximum retention of nutrients.\n\n\u2022\n\nAccording to Ayurveda sweet, fruit deserts should be taken at the beginning of a meal rather than at the\nend. Sweet tastes satisfy hunger and quench the appetite and therefore reduce the need for large\namounts of food. Fruit that is left sitting behind the main meal waiting to be digested (up to six hours)\ncan ferment and produce large amounts of gas and bloating. This destroys the \u2018good\u2019 digestive flora\nand encourages the production of \u2018bad\u2019 digestive flora/bacteria.\n\n\u2022\n\nTo properly digest a meal the stomach should be no more than a third full. A third should contain food,\na third the liquid you have been consuming before the meal and a third air or space. This allows the\ndigestive juices to fully break down the food contained there.\n\n\u2022\n\nAnother ayurvedic tip for digestion is to drink a fresh yogurt drink called Lassie either during or after\nthe meal. This drink consists of 1/4 cup fresh homemade yogurt, 1 cup room temperature water and\nsugar to taste. Blend it for one minute in the blender.

These can be found is fresh deep-sea fish such as mackerel, sardines and salmon\nand in many freshly-ground nuts and seeds. However, the best way to ensure an adequate intake is by\nadding oil to your food. Olive oil is good but flax oil, pumpkin oil and borage oil are better. Better still\nis a specially formulated blend called \u2018Udo\u2019s oil\u2019 (see \u2018Savant\u2019 in the resources section) which contains\nall the essential fatty acids or omegas in their ideal ratios for optimum health and nutrition.\n\n20\n\n\f\u2022\n\nFruits and vegetables contain lots of phyto-nutrients, and a variety of senses-pleasing colours, tastes and\ntextures. Ayurveda has always recommended eating lots of fruits and vegetables, not only for their\nnutritional value, but also because they are natural internal cleansers. Modern research concurs that\nfruits and vegetables are powerful disease-prevention foods - in fact, it is now recommended that you\neat nine servings of antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables a day to prevent cancer and other free radical\ninduced diseases.\n\n\u2022\n\nEat naturally intelligent foods. Almost three-quarters of the products sold in supermarkets contain\ngenetically modified ingredients and many of the chemicals and pesticides used in growing foods have\nbeen linked to numerous diseases. Processed foods, genetically modified foods, and foods to which\nadditives or artificial preservatives have been added are no longer alive with the intelligence of nature.\nAccording to ayurveda, the human physiology is a reflection of the laws of the universe, and the more\nin tune our lives are with nature, the healthier we are likely to be. Our digestive system is designed to\nprocess foods that are closest to nature - whole grains, pulses, fruits and vegetables. Help your\ndigestion function optimally by choosing organic foods whenever possible - your health is worth the\nextra cost.\n\n\u2022\n\nCook your food correctly. The purpose of ayurvedic cooking is to combine the intelligence of the\nspices, the intelligence of vegetables and the intelligence of the fat - all the different enzymes and\nenergetics - in a way that is not confusing for your body's intelligence to break down and incorporate.\nAyurvedic cooking methods are easy on the digestive system. You can prepare ayurvedic vegetables in\none of two ways. The first way is to steam the vegetables and then add the spices which have been\nsaut\u00e9ed in ghee, coconut oil or olive oil. The second way is to saut\u00e9 the spices in ghee, coconut oil or\nolive oil and to then add the vegetables and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes. Cover and cook at low\ntemperature. If you are making a curry (vegetables with sauce), add a small amount of water to finish\ncooking the vegetables\n\n\u2022\n\nGive your digestive system a break. According to ayurveda, the build up of ama or toxins in the\nphysiology is the root cause of most disorders. That's why ayurveda recommends internal cleansing at\nthe change of each season for optimal health. During internal cleansing, eat light yet nourishing foods\nsuch as mung bean soup or kicharee and drink lots of warm water or \u2018Detox Tea\u2019 through the day. See\n\u2018teas\u2019 in recipe section. Fresh, sweet juicy fruits are excellent cleansers. Periodic internal cleansing gets\nrid of accumulated junk from inside the body and boosts the digestion for the next season.\n\n\u2022\n\nTriphala is an excellent aid to elimination and purification and will help strengthen and purify the\ndigestive/immune system. It is best taken in the late evening. A herbal paste called Chywanaprash is\nalso excellent in this regard.\n\n\u2022\n\nWater is essential for good, digestion, ridding the body of toxins, maintaining immunity and healthy\nskin. When the water is herbalised it has an even stronger, more beneficial action.\nFor kapha types: To a thermos of boiled water, add 2 thin slices of fresh ginger root, 2 basil leaves, 2\nwhole cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of whole cumin seeds and 2 pinches licorice powder.

If you exercise at fifty percent capacity at the same time\nevery day, eat at the same time and sleep at the same time, your body will respond with better digestion,\nbetter sleep and overall better immunity. Yoga, walking, cycling, dancing and swimming are all\nexcellent in this regard. The way to tell if you are exerting more than fifty percent capacity and starting\nto exceed your capacity is if sweat starts to form on your nose, forehead or under the arms. Another\nsign is if you can no longer breathe through the nose. Breathing through the nose is recommended for\nayurvedic exercise. If you start to need to gulp air through the mouth, it's time to slow down or stop. If\nyou follow this one guideline, you will always feel energized by exercise instead of exhausted. Each\nday, you will find that your capacity increases and that you can exercise more intensely or for a longer\nduration. Very naturally you will be able to handle more exercise without ever straining.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe practices of meditation, chanting and pranayama will also help balance the mind, subtly tone the\nbody, improve digestion and massively reduce stress.\n\n\u2022\n\nRetiring to bed early and waking early is necessary for the maintenance of hormone balance in the mind\nand body \u2013 this creates happiness and a stress-free mind; the prerequisite of proper digestion.\n\n\u2022\n\nBetter relationships are formed when the mind and body are in harmony. The beauty of Ayurveda is\nthat it takes into account all areas of life. While you may think that your problems with relationships\nstart with the other person, the fact remains that you can change only yourself. Most relationships go\nwrong when the people involved start blaming each other. If you stop and look within, you will surely\nfind that blame doesn't always lie with the other person. At the basis of all relationships is the human\nheart. The heart is the seat of Sadhaka Pitta, the sub-dosha of Pitta concerned with emotions. To use\nmodern terminology, Sadhaka Agni is related to the neuro-hormones that are located in the brain and all\nover the body, including the heart. The neuro-hormones located in the heart send signals to the brain to\nregister depression or happiness, depending on how the individual processes an experience.\nIt is important to understand and thereby respect the special psycho-emotional makeup of others.\nRather than blame others for reacting differently than we do, it's better to develop understanding and\ntolerance, based on the knowledge of Ayurvedic mind-body types. If you are feeling irritated with\nsomeone, it's best to look to your own physiology rather than blame him or her. Once we start to live\nmore in harmony with nature we are naturally more tolerant and forgiving. Good digestion not only\npositively effects our physical health but our mental and emotional health as well but. This also works\nthe other way round; better relationships create better digestion, better health and a happier life.\n\n22\n\n\fOther nutritional considerations\nWater\nWater is essential to life. It has many healing properties and contributes up to 70% of our body weight. It keeps\nthe skin soft, supple and free of wrinkles, removes inorganic mineral deposits, flushes out toxins, prevents\nconstipation, protects against viruses/infections and helps remove cholesterol and excess fat. The type of water\nwe drink today, and the insufficient amounts consumed, contribute to arteriosclerosis, illness and premature\naging. Unfortunately tap water often contains the residues or homeopathic concentrations of modern drugs and\nhormones which are not removed during the filtration process at sewage plants. It may also contain toxic\nchemicals such as chlorine and fluoride. Even today\u2019s naturally distilled water, rain, is often polluted by our\nindustrial technology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3044d3b3-cbff-4d31-99a9-411e2c05b6dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "3044d3b3-cbff-4d31-99a9-411e2c05b6dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "4273b720-8885-4acc-bbdd-525af6a2614e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "03dbc18b4028b97faa99ddf35b0cdb788c4a26a1ba7dcfed44d97683926df176"}, "3": {"node_id": "401e0f68-58de-49e0-a943-9ee6b1d97086", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "65d5278a4f12fde65b2cfd3b4b58bb6fd34e88215b9ec5f38c0430675d2df4a4"}}, "hash": "9d56f65152a65e18d06f4ab182463f895e384eb24357e23803c8d0f51a9a0158", "text": "Bottled water, water filters water purifiers, water coolers, water softeners, reverse osmosis\nsystems and water distillers may help rectify this situation. However, whilst distilled water contains only pure\nH2O - water that is free from harmful inorganic compounds, toxic chemicals, bacteria and viruses - the electricity\nand heat used to produce it may reduce it\u2019s \u2018life-energy\u2019 or prana.\nWe should ideally drink between 1 - 2 litres per day depending on our body-type. Just as we use hot water to\nsoften and dissolve impurities and fat from our dishes, pots and pans so too should we use it to detoxify our\nbody. Cold water hardens and congeals fat in our body whilst hot water softens and dissolves fat. Cold water\nslows down our digestive capabilities and hinders digestion whilst hot water speeds up our metabolism and helps\nthe digestive process. Body or room temperature water is relatively neutral and preferable to cold water\nconsumption. Water combined with tea or coffee acts as a diuretic and should be followed by an equal amount of\nplain water to prevent dehydration. Adding a slice of lemon or ginger to our hot water can help the cleansing\nprocess and further improve digestion.\nTable Salt (sodium chloride)\nTable salt is subject to very high temperatures during the refining process which hardens the grains and allows\nthem to flow more easily - it also renders them virtually insoluble in water and difficult for the body to\nmetabolise. This can cause water-logging of our tissues, increased blood pressure and encrustation of the\narteries, veins and capillaries. We should therefore reduce the use of refined table salt and favour natural salts\nsuch as unrefined sea salt, black or rock salt instead. Kelp and other seaweeds are also excellent sources of\norganic sodium as are many vegetables; celery being especially good.\nMeat Products\nMeat is often high in saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which may contribute to clogging of the arteries. It\ncan also contain dangerous microbes such as salmonella and E.coli, as well as many residual antibiotics and\nsteroids. Red meat in particularly is very heating to the body and very difficult to digest. It is best to obtain our\nprotein from grains, cereals, soya products, pulses, lentils, nuts and seeds. However, if meat forms a large part of\nyour diet; eat organic, favour chicken and fish and ensure an adequate supply of fresh fruit, pure water and\nvegetables.\nProcessing and Refining Foods\nThese modern techniques reduce the nutritional value of foodstuffs by as much as 95%. Many have sugar or salt\nadded to improve taste or prolong shelf life, while others contain inorganic minerals, flavouring and synthetic\nadditives. The body cannot utilise these harmful substances and wastes a great deal of energy in its attempt to\nexpel them from our body. Consuming vast quantities of these products inevitably leads to ill health and\npremature aging as the body builds up toxic substances it has failed to eliminate.\nCarbohydrates, Oils and Fats\nThese play an essential role in our body and are responsible for our energy levels, tissue repair, hormone\nproduction and vitamin assimilation. Fast releasing carbohydrates such as refined white sugar are best avoided\n\n23\n\n\fwhile slow releasing carbohydrates found in whole-grains, fruit and vegetables are vital for proper cell-to-cell\ncommunication and tissue functioning. Oils high in linoleic acid and/or alpha-linoleic acid are essential to the\nbody. Hemp, Flax, Pumpkin, Walnut, Udo\u2019s and Soya bean oil are excellent with Sunflower, Safflower,\nSesame, Rice Bran and Evening Primrose coming a close second. Again, the refining and processing of these\noils destroys their life-enhancing properties and renders them harmful to the body. It is best to try and obtain\norganic, unrefined, cold-pressed oils whenever possible and to remember that only small quantities are required\nby the body each day for optimum health and vitality.\nVitamins and minerals\nWhilst the body requires an abundant supply of vitamins and minerals it is generally accepted that the soil our\nfood is grown in is no longer as effective in supplying these nutrients as it once was. Our soils are over-used and\ncrop rotation has become a thing of the past so nutrients are taken out but not returned.\nNon-organic produce is further disadvantaged by the fact that the pesticides, fungicides and insecticides, used to\nhelp increase production, prevent the plants from producing many of the nutrients in the quantities that we\nrequire for good health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "401e0f68-58de-49e0-a943-9ee6b1d97086": {"__data__": {"id_": "401e0f68-58de-49e0-a943-9ee6b1d97086", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3044d3b3-cbff-4d31-99a9-411e2c05b6dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d56f65152a65e18d06f4ab182463f895e384eb24357e23803c8d0f51a9a0158"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7b0dfe4-29f0-4734-9543-5d8c7ba08385", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8610d35cc7dec0d1b150931243bc31e6d0effd20c03930a7afd98f38471da374"}}, "hash": "65d5278a4f12fde65b2cfd3b4b58bb6fd34e88215b9ec5f38c0430675d2df4a4", "text": "Fertilisers may be added to the soil but these again are mainly inorganic and do not\npossess the wide spectrum of minerals required for good health \u2013 if certain minerals are not put back into the soil\nthe plant will no longer possess them in it\u2019s make-up and we will therefore no longer have them in our diets.\nHowever, supplementing our diet with vitamin and mineral supplements may have limited effect and may even\nbe detrimental to our health.

Thirdly, we all have different body-types and therefore different vitamin/mineral requirements so\nno one pill will suit all people. What may be beneficial for one person may be detrimental to the next and cause\nfurther toxicity in the body.\nThe only way to really guarantee we ingest all the nutrients we need in their correct form, combination and\nquantity is to eat the correct foods, ie; fresh, organic produce. If we were to eat the recommended five servings\nof organic fruit, vegetables and grains per day and vary the type of produce we choose each day this would go\nmost of the way towards ensuring better health. If we were also to choose foods suitable for our body type this\nwould help still further. If we were to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables we ate each day by\nsupplementing our diet with freshly prepared vegetable juices, which are very easy to digest, we would be eating\nas healthily as is possible is today\u2019s world.\nLeafy Greens\nDark leafy green vegetables such as collard greens, spinach, swiss chard, mustard greens, bok choy greens,\nsorrel, turnip greens and many varieties of kale are considered a particularly nutritious class of vegetables. They\ncontain important minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin B1 and\nvitamin B2. Ayurveda recommends that we have some leafy greens each day to help meet the nutritional\nrequirements for optimal health.\nLeafy greens help replenish liquid in the body and refresh and purify the subtle channels called shrotas. They\nalso supply prana or life energy that provides sustenance to mind and body. They help balance pitta and kapha.\nPeople who need to balance vata should eat them prepared with ghee or olive oil and vata balancing spices. They\nare very beneficial for people suffering from skin problems as they are cooling, gently purifying and nourishing\nfor the skin. Due to the high mineral content of calcium and vitamin A, leafy greens are highly beneficial for\nreproductive health and menopause. They contain antioxidants that help to prevent aging and disease.\n\n24\n\n\fThere are different methods of cooking leafy greens. Some are tender and cook very quickly whilst others, such\nas kale, may need cooking longer. It is best to keep the leaf part whole when cooking. However, if there are\ntough stems, such as on collard greens and kale, then it is best to slice the stem into bite size pieces. The tough\nstem should be cooked until tender or it may cause abdominal discomfort.\nGenetic engineering\nThis technology involves inserting genetic material from animals, insects, virus\u2019s and other organisms into the\nDNA of food products such as corn, soybeans, and tomatoes. From an Ayurvedic perspective nature's innate\norganizing power or intelligence is woven into the DNA and determines the characteristics of different species.\nBy splicing foreign genetic material into the DNA of a plant, the plant's fundamental connection with the\nwholeness of life is damaged. This damage gets passed on to us at the dinner table.\nThe ayurvedic texts define the source of all disease and suffering as pragyaparadh, or \"the mistake of the\nintellect.\" This occurs when individuals (or even single cells) \"forget\" their connections with the wholeness of\nlife and believe themselves to be isolated entities.

The genetic program of a living organism is vastly more powerful and more\ncomplex than limited human intelligence.\nTherefore, consuming genetically food exposes us to unknown forces that may seriously damage the fine tuning\nand functioning of our physiology and cause long-tem chronic health problems.\nThe adverse effects of eating microwaved food\nMicrowave cooking is one of the most important causes of ill health but has largely been ignored by the\npublic due to its speed and convenience. Russian research concerning adverse neurological effects of altered\nmagnetic states of microwaved foods caused the Russian government to outlaw all food microwave apparatus in\n1976 (this law was unfortunately lifted after Perestroika).\nAnother study reported in the US journal Paediatrics (vol. 89, no. 4, April 1992) showed depletion of antibodies\nand breakdown of enzymes when breast milk is microwaved. The US Food and Drug Association also found a\nproblem with the release of potentially toxic molecules into the food from packaging designed to help brown\nfood during microwaving.\nMicrowaves also tend to heat foods unevenly, indicating that some of the food is not sufficiently heated to kill\nall the bacteria or parasites that might be present. This uneven heating also creates hot spots in food that may\nrelease synthetic oestrogens found in certain plastics. But even when using only glass (Pyrex) containers, low\nlevels of radiation escaping from the ovens may be harmful.\nTwo researchers, Dr. Bernard H. Blanc and Dr. Hans Hertel, confirmed that microwave cooking significantly\nchanges food nutrients and has a detrimental effect on the human body. Their research revealed the following\nabout microwaved food:\n\u2022\n\nThe body cannot recognise and consequently not metabolize radiolytic byproducts (isomers) created in\nmicrowaved food. These by-products accumulate in the body.\n\n\u2022\n\nMale and female hormone production is altered by continually eating microwaved food.\n\n\u2022\n\nMinerals, vitamins and nutrients are quantitatively reduced and qualitatively altered, so that the body\ngets little or no benefit, and absorbs these altered compounds that cannot be broken down.\n\n25\n\n\f\u2022\n\nThe minerals in vegetables are altered into cancerous free-radicals.\n\n\u2022\n\nMicrowaved food causes stomach and intestinal tumours as well as cancerous cells in the blood.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe prolonged eating of microwaved food causes increase of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\n\u2022\n\nContinually eating food processed in a microwave oven gradually causes brain damage by de-polarising\nor de-magnetising brain tissue.\n\n\u2022\n\nContinual ingestion of microwaved food causes immune system deficiencies through lymph gland and\nblood serum alterations (increase of white and decrease of red blood cells).\n\n\u2022\n\nEating microwaved food causes loss of memory and concentration, emotional instability and a decrease of\nintelligence.\n\nMicrowaved blood kills patient\nIn 1991, there was a lawsuit in Oklahoma concerning the hospital use of a microwave oven to warm blood\nneeded in a transfusion. The case involved a hip surgery patient, Norma Levitt, who died from a simple blood\ntransfusion. It seems the nurse had warmed the blood in a microwave oven. This tragedy makes it very apparent\nthat there's much more to \"heating\" with microwaves than we've been led to believe. Blood for transfusions is\nroutinely warmed, but not in microwave ovens. In the case of Mrs. Levitt, the microwaving altered the blood and\nit killed her. It's very obvious that this form of microwave radiation \"heating\" does something to the substances it\nheats. It's also becoming quite apparent that people who process food in a microwave oven are also ingesting\nthese \"unknowns\". Because the body is electrochemical in nature, any force that disrupts or changes human\nelectrochemical events will affect the physiology of the body.\nAlso, from an Ayurvedic perspective, food cooked in this unnatural way lacks prana or \u2018life-energy\u2019 and has\nlittle usefulness as part of a healthy balanced diet. However, whichever way you look at it, there appears to be\nvery serious concerns regarding the safety of eating food cooked in micro-waved ovens and therefore subject to\nhigh frequency, alternating current electromagnetic waves.

It is good for digestion, cleansing and elimination. Take about 30mls of the juice each day.\nTurmeric is both bitter and astringent and is a blood purifier and antioxidant. One teaspoon cooked with\nyour meals is an excellent way to increase antioxidant intake.

Our daily\nactivities have a profound effect on our health and a routine, practiced daily, is stronger medicine than an\noccasional remedy. Dinacharya establishes healthful habits through attunement of the body to the natural cycles\nof the day. The three doshas, vata, pitta and kapha, each have their own periods of time within a twenty-four\nhour day in which their energies predominate. By establishing a routine that \u201cgoes with the flow \u201d of these\nelemental energies, we are able to more easily support the body \u2019s natural rhythms and healing potential.\nWaking\nThe first Vata period of the day ends around dawn with the first rays of sunlight. At this time of day Vata\nqualities are at their strongest and if we arise between 4\u20136am we will imbibe the positive qualities of alertness,\nvibrancy, enthusiasm, energy, clarity, strengthened intuition and motivation. It is the most sattvic, peaceful, and\nstill time of day and is an ideal time for spiritual practice. If there are time constraints we can simply take a few\ndeep breaths and adopt an attitude of gratitude for waking up to an exciting new day.\nElimination\nOur bladder and colon should be emptied upon rising. To facilitate this practice we can drink a glass or two of\nwarm water with a slice of lemon added. This helps rehydrate the tissues, flush toxins that have accumulated\novernight, enkindles agni or digestive fire and stimulates peristalsis.\nCleansing the senses\nAyurveda recommends purifying the senses each day in preparation for taking in all the rich, new experiences\nthat life has to offer. Refresh and energise the mind by splashing the face and eyes with cool or luke-warm water.\nGently wash the ears and apply a thin coat of sesame oil to the inside of the ear with your little finger. Use a neti\npot with saline solution to cleanse the nasal passages. Brush the teeth. Scrape the tongue using a tongue cleaner\nto remove any coating. Notice your tongue each morning. A thick coating is indicative of ama, or toxins in the\ndigestive tract. Scraping the tongue helps to purify your sense of taste and benefits the internal organs. Finally,\ngargle with warm water, or salt water and turmeric to help purify and strengthen the voice and keep the gums,\nmouth and throat healthy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe98c0c9-3511-47ad-a316-441f46c2962b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe98c0c9-3511-47ad-a316-441f46c2962b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f36b2550-0d79-4900-aa80-fb86046b98f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a367afc5ddbfaeb3f5c9cef15b73b0c5d3e3019ca022b99c44043cb3c506c4af"}, "3": {"node_id": "93961430-3a51-4b8d-a704-b2ed31e80d97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f8eb997590de275296d234348b222e123c688802c032c2ecada6ac685385ee2"}}, "hash": "4cb4357f81cf94ebfaef5d4000843f115b1bd2c96d9bdbe63fadd43f7bb71641", "text": "Abhyanga\nAccording to Ayurveda, abhyanga, or oil massage is an essential component of dinacharya. This practice\nnourishes and strengthens the body, encourages regular sleep patterns, stimulates internal organs, enhances blood\ncirculation and can significantly reduce vata.\nBathe\nAfter you have massaged your entire body, enjoy a warm bath or shower using a minimal amount of mild soap.\nTowel dry with a towel you do not mind collecting oil with.\nClothing\nAlways wear clean clothing, preferably made from natural fibres such as cotton, wool, linen or silk. Ayurveda\ndiscourages wearing used clothing, particularly other peoples\u2019 shoes, because of the polluted subtle energies\nwhich they collect.\nTake your herbs\nTaking herbs at the same time each day will enhance their medicinal effect. Herbs taken on an empty stomach\nhave the most potent action in the body.\n\n30\n\n\fMild exercise\nDaily exercise increases circulation and oxygenation of the tissues, strengthens agni, tones the body, reduces fat\nand enhances vitality. Determine the best time to exercise and what form of exercise to practice with\nconsideration to your prakriti (constitutional type) and the effects of the seasons. For example, in the fall, a vata\nperson should exercise during the kapha time of day, to take advantage of kapha\u2019s grounding and stable qualities.\nChoose an activity that is soothing to the nervous system like yoga or tai chi.\nMeditation\nJust as we cleanse our bodies each day, we must also cleanse our minds of accumulated thoughts that no longer\nserve us. Be still. Direct your attention inward. Notice your breath. Practice pranayama. Meditate for twenty\nminutes or simply invite calm and relaxation into the body if time is limited. This practice acts as a protective\nshield to the destabilizing influences of the external environment.\nAerobic exercise\nThe next morning period is Kapha which has the qualities of heaviness, slowness and stability \u2013 the later a\nperson awakes after dawn the more of these qualities he imbibes within his physiology and carries with him for\nthe rest of the day. Kapha time (especially between 7am and 10am) is the best time for more physical exercise,\nsuch as jogging, swimming or cycling.\nWork and lunch\n10am to 2pm, when pitta predominates, is the most productive time for work, especially for problem solving or\ncompleting tasks that requires your full attention and focus. It is also the time when the sun is at its peak and\nwhen the digestive fire or agni is at its strongest. It is therefore the ideal time to eat the largest meal of the day.\nEating at this time will allow efficient and maximum digestion, assimilation and metabolism. Proper absorption\nof minerals, vitamins, proteins and carbohydrates will result in efficient energy production and feelings of\nstrength and alertness. It follows that there will also be less desire for snacking and overeating if the diet\ncontains adequate nutrition and the ability to properly assimilate it. A short, leisurely stroll shortly after lunch\nwill also aid digestion.\nCreative work\nVata comes around again during the afternoon. This is a good time for mental agility and creative work. Vata\ntypes may experience a drop in energy at this time and a small snack is valuable for them.\nEvening meal\nOnly light meals should be eaten in the evenings (toast, rice, semolina, milk drinks, noodles, soup etc). It is\nimportant to have allowed enough time for your previous meal to have been digested thoroughly (generally 4\nhours) but should ideally be taken before sundown and at least three hours before bedtime.\nRelaxation\nThe next Kapha period begins in the early evening. The heavy, slow, stable qualities of this dosha increase as\nthe evening progresses and reach their peak a couple of hours before midnight. In order to imbibe these qualities\nand ensure a sound, heavy, undisturbed and restful sleep one should be in bed before this period ends. Evening\nis a kapha energy period and is a time to relax, engage in pleasant conversation with family or friends, read light\nnovels or play gentle, soothing music. It is a time to unwind from the stimulation and activity of the day. About\nhalf an hour before bedtime is the perfect time to take Triphala tea to gentle tone and balance to the digestive\ntract.\nBathing\nAyurveda sees bathing as a therapeutic activity and the evening is a good time to partake in this therapy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93961430-3a51-4b8d-a704-b2ed31e80d97": {"__data__": {"id_": "93961430-3a51-4b8d-a704-b2ed31e80d97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe98c0c9-3511-47ad-a316-441f46c2962b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4cb4357f81cf94ebfaef5d4000843f115b1bd2c96d9bdbe63fadd43f7bb71641"}, "3": {"node_id": "b19c697e-4b5c-4c86-b85d-04a6ee54cb94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5dadf956d5869da15da03fa8b10e4f2816d36364c0f0212963c449a2d68adf61"}}, "hash": "5f8eb997590de275296d234348b222e123c688802c032c2ecada6ac685385ee2", "text": "A\nleisurely bath relaxes tense muscles, irons out a creased brow, opens clogged pores, restores moisture to the\ntissues, and adds a healing dimension to your day.

The ancient ayurvedic texts also\nrecommend adding rose petals, milk, honey, and turmeric to your bath. After you towel off, spritz your body\nwith rose water.\nSleep\nFinally, the next active Pitta period runs from 10pm until about 2am. If one is not asleep during this period the\nbody begins to wake up and one attains a second wind around 11pm, which may have you up until 1am! Sleep is\nthen impaired and the elimination of impurities and toxins within the body suffers greatly. Being in bed by 10pm\nwill ensure 6-7 hours of refreshing, detoxifying sleep that will leave you revitalised and re-energised. It is a good\npractice to apply oil to the scalp and the soles of the feet before bed to calm the nervous system and promote\nsound sleep.\nThis Pitta period is also a second \u2018digestive phase\u2019 but it is not intended for digesting large quantities of food or\nheavy foodstuffs. The metabolism work differently than at midday and is far less efficient in terms of breaking\ndown the contents of the stomach and intestines. It will try to digest them as well as possible but usually leaves\nthe process incomplete leading to a further build up of undigested food or \u2018Ama\u2019 (hence the very furry, white\ntongue in the morning after a late night of alcohol and heavy food). This is why the evening meal should be light\nand easily digestible.\nFollowing dinacharya is a way to bring more awareness to all of the habits and choices we make throughout the\nday. Conscious awareness in our daily lives enables us to be whole and healthy beings, bringing us closer to our\ntrue selves. Living in harmony with the cycles of nature is not only the path to health, but to true freedom.\n\nSeasonal Rhythms\nAs the day goes through a cycle of Vata, Pitta and Kapha so does the year.\nThe qualities of Vata are cold and moving (wind) and these qualities are prevalent in the winter. Vata-types\nespecially must try to follow a Vata pacifying routine and diet at this time of year to prevent Vata dosha from\ndrifting out of balance. When the cool, dry winds begin to blow it can sometimes be difficult to maintain a\npeaceful, grounded state of being. Having a routine to follow restores balance throughout the day, everyday,\nsafeguarding against the anxiety and stress associated with increased vata.\nSummer is hot, just like Pitta dosha, and those prone to Pitta-type imbalances should keep cool and follow a Pitta\npacifying routine and diet.\nSpring (and to some extent autumn) can be cold and damp exhibiting the qualities of Kapha.

Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have a\nthermometer, simply add one or two drops of water to the oil before heating. Always use a medium heat and\nnever leave the room while oil is heating, as it is highly inflammable.\n\n35\n\n\fAs the oil heats a crackling sound is heard - this is the water boiling off. When the crackling stops the oil has\nreached the correct temperature. Allow the oil to cool. It is now ripened and can be stored in a suitable\ncontainer for up to one month. Re-ripen if stored for longer.\nHow to carry out your own Ayurvedic oil massage:\nCarry out your daily oil massage in a warm, comfortable room and heat the oil to body temperature before\napplying to the body (either place a small amount of oil in a small stainless steel bowl and warm over a candle\nburner or place the glass/plastic oil container in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes before use).\nStart by using coconut oil on the face and scalp, paying particular attention to the ears. Slow, gentle strokes are\npreferable. Sesame oil is used for the rest of the body. Start with the arms, paying particular attention to the\nhands and fingers. Next massage the front of the body with slow, gentle strokes over the abdomen. The back is\nsomewhat more awkward but do what you can reach \u2013 use the backs of your hands to cover more area. Massage\nthe buttocks and legs finishing with the feet (give a little extra time and attention here).\nAs a rule, circular massage strokes are used over joints and long sweeping movements along the arm/leg bones.\nFive or ten circles/long strokes per area should be given depending on the time available. For even greater\ntherapeutic effects a few drops of essential oil may be added to your massage oil. We recommend no more than\n10 drops of lavender, cederwood, sandalwood, patchouli, ylang ylang or frankincense per 100ml of massage oil.\nIt is beneficial to keep the oil on the skin for at least twenty minutes before showering. Water should be warm\nrather than hot and soap should be used sparingly to allow a residue of oil to remain on the skin.\nSesame oil\u2019s highly medicinal, therapeutic effects are probably due to its high linoleic content which has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties. However, if you find sesame oil too\nheating coconut oil, olive oil or sunflower can applied instead.\n\u201cThe body of one who uses oil massage regularly does not become affected much even if subjected to accidental\ninjuries, or strenuous work.

Perhaps in odd moments, while we\u2019re taking a break\nin a quiet park or have witnessed a beautiful sunset, a momentary peace and calmness suddenly descends,\nleaving us feeling refreshed and alert; bathed in a bubble of stillness and silence. This fleeting occurrence takes\nus by surprise but reminds us of the joy of life and the possibilities it could hold if only we could learn to enjoy\nit.\nWhat does not seem to be widely known is that this state is easily and effortlessly achieved through a few\nminutes\u2019 practice of an amazingly simple but effective technique known as meditation. It can be taught in a few\nminutes, can be practiced by anyone and will work anywhere.\nWith the help of a subtle sound or mantra the mind can effortlessly transcend to this silent state of heightened\nawareness and rest within minutes. What\u2019s more, the practice of this very simple technique helps build a solid\nfoundation for the mind, allowing it to effortlessly remain calm in the most stressful and demanding situations.\nMeditation allows the mind to see more clearly and work more efficiently and effectively for prolonged periods\nof time without becoming unduly tired or strained. Thus we can truly \u201cdo less and accomplish more\u201d.\nIt\u2019s our birthright to enjoy a healthy, stress-free life and this can be achieved by allowing the mind to rest and\nrecharge at regular intervals with a few minutes meditation; a technique which produces levels of rest and\nrelaxation many times more effective than sleep.\nProgressively, over the centuries, this natural mind-relaxing procedure has been complicated, mystified and\nwatered down. By many it is seen as a battle to conquer the mind and senses and thus best left to the spiritual\naspirant who has the time and will to perfect his/her technique. Meditation should be neither a process of deep\nconcentration nor one of intense contemplation \u2013 it is simply an effortless way of allowing the mind to transcend\nto deep levels of relaxation very quickly, easily and effortlessly.\nMeditation is simply a matter of being taught how to use specific internal sounds correctly so that they act as\nvehicles for the mind to experience progressively more subtle values of those sounds. Eventually, one\neffortlessly reaches the silent field of all possibilities where thoughts, words or sounds originate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c87a2c0d-c19c-471e-9bb7-b52429278004": {"__data__": {"id_": "c87a2c0d-c19c-471e-9bb7-b52429278004", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f38618ca-9dc9-4506-9b67-87b6b04bd460", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4407139ee22620418622c9bc2ac10d3327bf610b9f27f074cd38dd1c773f2606"}, "3": {"node_id": "32fb88de-b14d-4c9f-b8ff-da939c5a79a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7448efa396ceb6afe0d8905f989e93fb193d3fa620910e1146766e5bdf40850f"}}, "hash": "a47a7c56da86c27ca28d005825068b98d025201df946f5dd645ce37797059448", "text": "The practice described here involves simply sitting quietly in a calm and peaceful environment and observing the\ngentle inflow and outflow of ones breath.

Allow it to eventually fade away.\n\n\u2022\n\nAs it fades away the mind settles down, relaxes and occasionally transcends \u2013 often stresses are released\nas this happens. Stresses are released on the back of thoughts \u2013 thus, as you release stress you will have\nthoughts. The more powerful the stress being released the more powerful and absorbing the thoughts will\nbe that surface in your awareness.\n\n\u2022\n\nAs soon as you become aware of thoughts other than the mantra (\u2018so-hum\u2019) gently \u2018favour\u2019 the mantra\nagain \u2013 i.e, gently, innocently and effortlessly go back to witnessing the mantra.

This is a\nsign of correct meditation. Meditation releases stress \u2013 hence thoughts will frequently arise.\n\n\u2022\n\nMeditation is only experienced as \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018boring\u2019 when we start straining to \u2018hold\u2019 the mantra in our\nawareness and \u2018try\u2019 to \u2018focus\u2019 or \u2018concentrate\u2019 on keeping the mantra present in our mind and \u2018keeping\u2019 or\n\u2018forcing\u2019 other thoughts out. Thoughts are part of meditation \u2013 thoughts are good \u2013 thoughts are stresses\ndisappearing forever.\n\n\u2022\n\nMeditation is not about concentrating, focusing, contemplating or forcing the mind.

Avoid practicing immediately after a large meal or before bedtime (it wakes you up!).\n\n\u2022\n\nTry and practice at the same times each day so that the mind already comes prepared.

Through this awareness, and with a little practice, we\nlearn how to access our inner wisdom and increase our Prana, the omnipresent life force, that determines the\namount of energy, clarity and joy we have in our lives.\nPranayama is best practiced in the early morning when the mind is clear and free from the experiences of the\nday. Also, practiced after yoga asana, it can be the perfect transition into meditation. This is also a useful and\nsimple tool to bring us into balance before an exam, meeting or presentation. Just a few minutes can bring us\nback to our centre, easing anxiety and nervous tension.\nAlternate Nostril Breathing (Vata Pranayama): Nadi Shodhana, or alternate nostril breathing, is a type of\npranayama that balances the right and left hemispheres of the brain and has a calming effect on the nervous\nsystem while creating a more alert mind. It cleanses the channels of the subtle energy body by removing\nenergetic blockages along the nadis (channels) that correspond to the nerve ganglia on either side of the spinal\ncord. It is extremely centering, making it one of the best practices for vata dosha.\nBegin by sitting comfortably on a cushion, folded blanket or in a chair, keeping the head and spine upright.\nBring awareness to your breathing process, noticing the quality and length of each inhalation and exhalation.\nBreathe deep into your abdomen and keep the body relaxed.\nPosition the right hand (you may choose to alternate with each practice) in vishnu mudra by folding the index\nfinger and third finger inwards to lightly touch at the base of the thumb. Your little finger rests by the side of the\nring finger. You will alternately use your thumb to close your right nostril and your ring and little fingers,\nworking as one, to close your left. Rest your left hand comfortably in your lap. The breath should never feel\nforced.\nInstructions: Breathe in gently keeping the breath relaxed, subtle and light. Block the right nostril with\nthe thumb of the right hand and breathe out through the left nostril. Breathe in gently through the left nostril and\nthen block the left nostril with the fourth finger and breathe out through the right nostril. Breathe in through the\nright nostril, block the right nostril and breathe out through the left nostril. Continue for five minutes and finish\nby breathing in through the right nostril. If you are left-handed you will reverse these finger positions (thumb\nblocks left nostril and fourth finger blocks right nostril). Always breathe in and out gently; do not force the\nbreath and do not hold the breath. Breathe naturally and try to sit upright and in a relaxed and comfortable\nposition. Envision the breath as a light thread of silk, lengthening effortlessly with each inhalation and\nexhalation. Practice for five to ten minutes.\nRest after your practice and notice how you are feeling. Once comfortable with this practice, you can begin\nmentally counting to four on your inhalation, pause at the space between the breath and then count to four as you\nexhale, so that the length of your inhalation and exhalation are equal.\nThere are many variations of alternate nostril breathing. These advanced practices involve increased ratios of\ninhalation to exhalation, longer duration, and the incorporation of breath retention. It is best to practice these\nunder the guidance of a yoga teacher or therapist. They are intended as developmental stages to work through\nincrementally as the body gradually adjusts to the increased flow of prana. As with any subtle energy practice\nwhich activates prana, it is best to start slowly and steadily incorporate it into your daily practice. A shorter\npractice on a consistent basis will bring more benefit to the body than a longer practice every now and again.\n\n40\n\n\fHere are some variations that will help with specific dosha imbalances within the physiology:\nLeft Nostril Breathing (Pitta Pranayama): This breathing exercise helps cool the mind and body and is excellent\nfor Pitta imbalances.

Repeat for five to ten minutes, finishing by breathing out through your right nostril\nRight Nostril Breathing (Kapha Pranayama): Helps warm the body and is excellent for Kapha imbalances. If\nthe right nostril is blocked the body often feels cold.\nInstructions: Block your left nostril with your fourth finger (thumb if left-handed) and inhale gently\nthrough the right nostril. Block your right nostril with your thumb (fourth finger if left-handed) and breathe out\nthrough your left nostril. Repeat for five minutes, finishing by breathing out through your left nostril\nFast Pranayama: This practice speed up metabolism and helps with weight loss. It can also be practiced for 2030 seconds before \u2018alternate nostril breathing\u2019.\nInstructions: Repeatedly exhale quickly and forcefully through both nostrils. You will find that you\nnaturally inhale after each out breath. Repeat this for about one minute and then rest for one minute. Repeat up\nto five times. You may find that the body heats up and begins to perspire slightly indicating that energy is\nflowing and circulation is improving.\nHissing Breath: This is good for cleansing and detoxifying the lungs and improving lung capacity.\nInstructions: Take two deep abdominal breathes. On the next out-breath, breathe out through your teeth\nto make a \u2018hissing\u2019 sound. As you do so lean forward so that your head comes towards your knees. At the end\nout your out-breath immediately breathe in through your nose quite rapidly as your come up to an upright\nposition again. Once your lungs are three-quarters full and you are in an upright position hold your breath for as\nlong as is comfortable. Now repeat the process six more times.\nKapalabhati: This is also good for cleansing and detoxifying the lungs and improving lung capacity.\nInstructions: Take two deep abdominal breathes. Now breathe in to three-quarters capacity. On the next outbreath, breathe out forcefully twenty times by repeatedly contracting the abdominal muscles. Now take two deep\nabdominal breathes and on the third, breathe in to three-quarters capacity and retain the breath for thirty seconds.\nRepeat this three more times. As you become more accomplished you can increase the number of \u2018abdominal\npumpings\u2019 - up to forty and maybe even sixty. You will also find that you will naturally be able to hold the\nbreath for longer \u2013 perhaps even up to two minutes duration.\nBelly Breath: This is good for toning the abdomen, improving peristalsis and helping with weight loss.\nInstructions: In a standing position bend your knees and rest your hands on the top of the knees breathe out fully (hold the breath) and then contract abdomen up into diaphragm/rib cage \u2013 hold for as long as is\ncomfortable. Exhale. Repeat this exercise several times. Alternatively you can repeatedly contract the abdomen\ninto diaphragm during the holding of the out-breath.\n\n41\n\n\fExercise\nExercise is an important part of the ayurvedic routine as it helps rid the body of heaviness and stiffness through\nthe burning of ama or toxins. It creates greater flexibility, lightness, energy and stamina. It also pacifies all three\ndoshas, creates balance, enhances digestion, improves immunity, dissolves impurities in the tissues, banishes\nfatigue, stops early aging and retards weight gain.\nHowever, too much exercise can be damaging, causing fatigue, lack of glow in the skin and face, pitta and vata\naggravation and strain on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. It can also create excess free radicals which\ndamage the body and have been linked to over eighty percent of degenerative disease as well as premature aging.\nAyurveda therefore recommends that no more than fifty percent of total capacity is utilised, with individual\ncapacity depending on daily fluctuations of energy, change of the seasons, age, and body type.\nVata types needs the least exercise, so lighter activities such as walking are best. Pitta types need moderate\namounts with swimming and skiing being good, whilst Kapha types need more intense exercise - jogging and\naerobics are good to help them stay in balance. Do more exercise in winter and spring and do less in hot weather\nas this will create fatigue, especially in pitta body types.\nAlways start out slowly and only gradually increase the intensity and duration of exercise.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f5ed1d1-4818-44aa-ba43-bdf0afe531da": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f5ed1d1-4818-44aa-ba43-bdf0afe531da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "23892495-132d-493f-8ce8-6b783926e5bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "64ab3c5e991d54439fc51259ddfb23650faf32373c3fda2ca3ebe2e49d2f095f"}, "3": {"node_id": "0727bd78-dabf-4bbb-ab52-f403730b71d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e42484d25717e40194831f45e4767a505328c598c1ccb05bccda4db9a2892ab4"}}, "hash": "0c2846bee8803e7570c11536e48d527ef74c94500b0b6ddbf7b9c71c1ad70131", "text": "Always start out slowly and only gradually increase the intensity and duration of exercise. Stop when you note\nsigns of overexertion. You know when you're doing the right amount of exercise if you feel energized and calm\nafterwards. If you feel strained and exhausted, you're doing too much. You can continue to exercise until you\nnotice one of the following two signs of overexertion:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nDifficulty in breathing through the nose. If you have to open your mouth to gulp in air, that's a sign that\nyour heart is overexerted, the circulation system is taxed and the coordination of heart and lungs is\ndisturbed. You should stop immediately.\nSweating on the forehead or the tip of nose. Sweating elsewhere in the body is fine but when you notice\nsweat in these two places it's a sign that you are overexerted and should stop.\n\nYoga asanas are the ideal form of exercise for all body types and ages, because they balance the three doshas,\ntone the muscles, and rejuvenate all the organs in the body. Practicing pranayama is also a good way to increase\nendurance. An abhyanga oil massage before exercise will tone the muscles, get the blood circulating and prevent\ninjury or strain\nExercise every day as part of your regular daily routine. If possible exercise in the morning before 10am as your\nbody has more strength, stamina, and coordination during the kapha time of day. Exercising at this time also\nenergizes you and prepares you for the day ahead. Exercising in the late evening or towards bedtime is not\nrecommended as it can elevate body temperatures and disrupt sleep rhythms. A light walk or yoga in the evening\nis fine. Also avoid exercise from 10am to 2pm, the pitta time of day, when the digestive fire is strong \u2013 this\nshould be reserved for eating the main meal of the day.\nIt's not a good idea to exercise on a full stomach - wait about two hours after eating a large meal. However, if\nyour stomach is empty and you are very hungry, have a light snack of fruit juice, cooked apples or some kind of\nlight soup before exercising.\nIt is important to breath through the nose at all time during exercise as this uses the whole of the lungs and not\njust the upper portions. If you are breathing through the mouth you are over-exerting.\n\n42\n\n\fIf you were at the zoo and a tiger escaped from its pen you would most likely take a quick upper-chest \u201cgasping\u201d\nemergency breath. This breath would trigger a fight-or-flight response in your nervous system as the upper lobes\nof the lungs are primarily innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. The kind of \u201cgasping\u201d mouth\nbreathing, much like a hyperventilation breathing pattern, is a normal breathing response to extreme stress.\nUnfortunately this how most people breathe during exercise and this triggers the same neurological response.\nIn contrast, the nerves that would calm, rejuvenate and regenerate the body are in the lower lobes of the lungs\nalong with the majority of the blood supply. The problem is that most people never breathe into these lower\nparasympathetic dominant lobes. They therefore create a minor but constant emergency situation which creates\nstress hormones and releases excess toxins into the body.\nThus, we can see that exercise can act as a double-edged sword, where it can either incur stress or remove stress,\ndepending on the quality of the breath. The best way to consistently breathe into the lower lobes of the lungs is\nby nasal breathing. The nose is intricately designed to filter, moisten and rarefy the air we take in and drive it\ninto the small and distal alveoli of the lungs. It is when these distal lobes are fully perfused with air that the body\nproduces a neurological state of composure even while under extreme stress\nIf you are unfit or aren\u2019t used to exercise first go for a short walk before attempting anything more physical. For\nthe first ten minutes breath in and out deeply through your nose as you walk fairly slowly. This ensures you are\nexercising your lungs. Be vigilant and make sure that each breath is deeper, longer and slower than the one\nbefore \u2013 however, the emphasis should always be on comfort rather than style. It is this experience of comfort\nthat you will eventually take you to higher levels of exertion. If you feel relaxed and comfortable, begin to walk\nfaster but be sure to maintain the same rhythm of the breath you established at the beginning.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0727bd78-dabf-4bbb-ab52-f403730b71d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0727bd78-dabf-4bbb-ab52-f403730b71d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f5ed1d1-4818-44aa-ba43-bdf0afe531da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c2846bee8803e7570c11536e48d527ef74c94500b0b6ddbf7b9c71c1ad70131"}, "3": {"node_id": "754bdd54-6272-4a8c-94bb-fc6ddf12f9ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1a51974624c9b687c88441daeefc26d6feb9c7c6b99397811bccb1e6c4a73ec"}}, "hash": "e42484d25717e40194831f45e4767a505328c598c1ccb05bccda4db9a2892ab4", "text": "At some point you will notice it becoming more difficult to get the air in through the nose and an ensuing urge to\ntake a mouth breath. When your exercise forces you to take your first mouth breathe, you have just forced the\nbody into an emergency breathing response to maintain that faster pace. Immediately slow down and recapture\nthe original deep, long and slow rhythm of the breath. Once it is re-established, try to walk faster again, telling\nyour body you want more performance. When the breathing gets laboured and you open your mouth again, slow\ndown once more. Constantly tell your body that you want more performance but that you don\u2019t want to create an\nemergency response. Soon your body will accommodate a higher level of a natural and more permanent fitness.\nBecause of the years of lower rib cage constriction you will more than likely find this difficult at first. But, what\nyou couldn't do the first day, you will find yourself effortlessly doing within two or three weeks, whilst\ncomfortably breathing through your nose. When this happens your rib cage is effectively and efficiently\nmassaging your heart and lungs up to 28,000 times a day. When this starts happening, a natural calming\ninfluence stays with you all day while you deal with all kinds of extreme stressors. Exercise has now become one\nof the your most important health-enhancing tools.\n\n43\n\n\fTips for enjoying exercise\nComfort: If your breath becomes laboured, your heart beats uncomfortably fast or you begin to ache or to get a\nstitch you are not within a zone of comfort and should slow down or stop and rest.\nUndivided Attention: Experience the body and respond to its signals. Do not watch TV or listen to music but\nallow the mind to be completely attuned and connected to the body.\nBody Type: Vata types should participate in calming activities such as walking, gymnastics, aerobics, dance,\ncycling, yoga or Tai Chi. Pitta types can cope with more vigorous exercise such as jogging, tennis, swimming,\nskiing, weight lifting and rowing but should be careful not to become too competitive or overheated. Kapha\ntypes need fast, vigorous exercise to counteract their more lethargic physiologies and are better suited to sports\nsuch as football, running, weight lifting, rugby and hockey.\nWarm up: Ensure you begin any training by first loosening the joints and muscles with a few gentle exercises,\nsun-salute (Suryanamaskara) and yoga.\nMassage: Applying oils before and after a workout is most beneficial. Vata-types should apply sesame or\nalmond oil with lavender before a workout and sesame or almond oil with marjoram after a workout; Pitta-types\nshould apply sesame or coconut oil with lemon before a workout and coconut oil with camomile afterwards\nwhile Kapha-types should apply olive or sesame oil with eucalyptus before and sesame or olive oil with\nrosemary after. A mix of 20:1 base oil to essential oil works well.\nBreathing: Always breathe through the nose as this uses the lower portion of the lungs where maximum energy\nis exchanged. This allows proper mind-body coordination by calming the body, slowing the heart rate and\nreducing the flow of adrenalin.\nStress Check: If on waking your resting heart rate is ten beats above or below normal you should rest or at least\nonly take very moderate exercise that day. This often indicates that the body is under stress, possibly from a\nvirus or bacteria, and the body will need its energy resources that day to combat this stress.\nOptimum Exercise Heart Rate (OEHR): 220 minus your age plus resting heart rate divided by two. Resting\nheart rate should be ascertained on waking in the morning.\nThree Phase Workout:\nResting Phase (10 min.): Do not allow heart rate to increase above OEHR minus 30.\nListening Phase (15 min): Increase pace but do not allow heart rate to increase above OEHR. Ensure heart rate,\nbreath rate, mental awareness and physical form are comfortable, balanced and correct.\nPerformance phase (10-30 min): Allow your pace to sit around the OEHR and experience comfort, balance, rest\nand euphoria. If at any time you feel uncomfortable, stressed or tired go back to the Resting or Listening Phase\nand build up again more slowly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "754bdd54-6272-4a8c-94bb-fc6ddf12f9ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "754bdd54-6272-4a8c-94bb-fc6ddf12f9ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "0727bd78-dabf-4bbb-ab52-f403730b71d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e42484d25717e40194831f45e4767a505328c598c1ccb05bccda4db9a2892ab4"}, "3": {"node_id": "a603b4bb-49bd-4d99-b641-627b3451494d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "298fc4818688dfb5761c03aefa768f8fde18c7c7fa0b3904118d68c53ed16e0a"}}, "hash": "b1a51974624c9b687c88441daeefc26d6feb9c7c6b99397811bccb1e6c4a73ec", "text": "44\n\n\fDaily exercise plan\nThe ideal morning exercise/relaxation routine includes:\n\u2022 Sun Salute (4-6 rounds)\n5-10 minutes\n\u2022 Short walk or run (1-2 mile)\n15-30 minutes\n\u2022 Yoga Asanas\n10-20 minutes\n\u2022 Pranayama & Meditation\n20-30 minutes\nWhen time is limited you can vary this routine.

It is a state of conscious deep sleep. You leave the waking state, go past the\ndreaming state, and enter a deep sleep, yet remain fully alert, aware and awake. It is a kind of \u2018psychic sleep\u2019\nproduced by a systematic method of inducing complete physical, mental and emotional relaxation, while\nmaintaining awareness at the deeper levels. It is a prolonged suspension between wakefulness and sleep. It\ninduces a higher state of consciousness - a wakeful state of deep introversion or an inner awareness. It is a\nmovement of consciousness rather than a deliberate auto-suggestion. You cannot relax by trying to relax - you\nneed to feel relaxed. After relaxing your body and calming your mind you can plant a few intentions, sankalpas,\nor assertions in your subconscious before detaching your mind and experiencing the final stage of deep\nrelaxation.\nThere is a close relationship between the body and the brain. Various centres in the brain control modify, and\naffect all our bodily functions. In fact, there is a centre in the brain for every act, whether wilful or reflex,\nphysical or mental. Experimental data have identified many such specific centres. Stimulation of these centres\nleads to appropriate actions, be they motor, sensory, emotive or cognitive. Thus we have a holographic\nrepresentation of the body on the brain with the left half of the body being represented in right half of the brain\nand the right half of the body being represented in left half of the brain.\nIn Yoga Nidra we make the brain centres active by focusing awareness on the parts of the body in a specific\nsequence. Thus, we try to stimulate various parts of the brain by focusing the awareness on the corresponding\nparts of the body. Awareness can be defined as adopting an attitude of witness towards physical or mental\nactions of the body.\nFrom the Yogic viewpoint the body and the mind (together with the emotions) are so interrelated that they are\nactually inseparable. The mind is not simply the thinking process relegated to the brain but is the sum total of the\nintelligence which permeates every atom of the physical and subtle organisms. Whatever affects the body must\ninfluence the mind and vice-versa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b77b397-837b-4bb7-8a68-0ce91e30d184": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b77b397-837b-4bb7-8a68-0ce91e30d184", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb542178-27ae-4faf-a264-d1f9205e60e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "907c8d2a4a4a4427cc066a0b3451f68271d010fa9d87dd261afe434fac517f49"}, "3": {"node_id": "a591f725-bdaf-4ec6-921c-08d7b869647b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14f7d539bba3c56bc43076ba36e0bc3f00674869b34142152826be384baee7c2"}}, "hash": "efaa40eb3ceb99b46858bade7d9cb46e3d92ee2eac6b3cbfa1b3fe88d7770ffc", "text": "Whatever affects the body must\ninfluence the mind and vice-versa. Since the mind is present throughout the body and permeates its every atom,\nthe Yoga techniques which we perform to stretch, strengthen and otherwise improve and develop the body must\nhave a correspondingly profound effect on the mind and the emotions\nAs we become more familiar with the practice of meditation and begin to perceive the more subtle levels of our\nthought process we also become faintly aware of the junction point between relative thought and transcendental\nawareness. It is from this threshold of conscious awareness that Yoga Nidra functions and it is from this field\nthat we are able to carry faint, positive intentions deep into our sub-conscious mind.\nWhilst this ancient technique has been part of the Tantric Yoga tradition for thousands of years there are now\nmany derivations of it in our western world. Most follow a fairly standard pattern of procedures, starting with an\nawareness of the breath, progressive relaxation, introducing a subtle intention and then a \u2018rotation of\nconsciousness\u2019 which involves rapidly placing awareness of various parts of the body in a specific sequence.\nYoga Nidra is primarily a technique of subtle intention and directed awareness. We have a very faint intention\nand then we very innocently direct that intention with our subtle awareness. The more innocently, faintly and\nsubtly we are able to do this the more powerful the results. It is a case of \u2018do less and accomplish more\u2019 \u2013 the\nless we try, and the less we allow our minds get in the way of our actions, the easier it becomes to accomplishes\nany difficult task.\nOur minds are very good at getting in the way of our intentions and often over-ride our intuition which is never\nwrong and always works for our highest good. We have almost become brainwashed or conditioned into\nbelieving that the harder we try, the more likely we are to accomplish the desired results. However, this is\n\n51\n\n\fusually our downfall and often leads to the accumulation of stress, and ultimately failure to achieve our goals in\nlife. Meditation and Yoga Nidra are both techniques that re-condition and retrain our minds to function on more\nsubtle and powerful levels \u2013 they re-educate the mind and remind it how to function properly. We so easily\nforget that some of the most amazing things we do take no effort whatsoever. Take the simple act of moving the\narm above the head \u2013 we just do it \u2013 we have the intention and the arm moves into exactly the position we\ndecided it should move. We do not have to think the thought over and over again until the arm finally moves by\nshear will power \u2013 it just moves in an instant.\nThink the word \u2018one\u2019 for the briefest of milliseconds and then spend a few minutes faintly observing how the\nword remains in the awareness long after you\u2019ve thought the word. A part of you recognises that even when the\nword appears to have drifted away completely, it could almost still be there in some dim and distant awareness.\nTry the same exercise with \u2018orange\u2019 \u2013 see an orange in your mind\u2019s eye and notice how the image stays \u2018in the\nmind\u2019s eye\u2019 long after you stopped the intention of visualising an orange. This is the same level and ease at\nwhich the \u2018mantra\u2019 in meditation and the various body-parts in Yoga Nidra are thought \u2013 there is no focus, no\nconcentration and no will power involved. The mind is taken out of the equation and the sub-conscious or\nintuitional mind takes over.\nAs a further example try this little task. Imagine that you are strolling along a country path. It suddenly becomes\nvery rough and you end up jumping from rock to rock. At one point you realise that the next jump will take you\nacross a deep cavern, one hundred feet deep with wild, swirling rapids below. Suddenly, actions that had been\nautomatic now become conscious. The rational, intellectual, thinking mind takes over \u2013 it over-rides the subconscious mind which was allowing the body to respond automatically, adjusting each step to land in exactly the\nright place for ease and safety. You stop dead in your tracks \u2013 the mind\u2019s saying, \u2018it\u2019s a long way down, you\ncould get hurt if you misjudge the next step, turn back, it\u2019s not safe to continue\u2019. However, if our \u2018conditioned,\nbrainwashed\u2019 mind hadn\u2019t taken over we would have just stepped over it, as it was no wider and no harder to\nstep over than any of the other gaps you\u2019d just crossed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a591f725-bdaf-4ec6-921c-08d7b869647b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a591f725-bdaf-4ec6-921c-08d7b869647b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b77b397-837b-4bb7-8a68-0ce91e30d184", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "efaa40eb3ceb99b46858bade7d9cb46e3d92ee2eac6b3cbfa1b3fe88d7770ffc"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8b2ad8a-9b68-4254-af8e-30cced19d286", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "42b962bd62515358f5dd9aeb1dd8f7a543c382e891253ff516804e9ed4be6763"}}, "hash": "14f7d539bba3c56bc43076ba36e0bc3f00674869b34142152826be384baee7c2", "text": "Similarly, image walking down the same country track and then coming across an electric fence that bars your\nway. There\u2019s a sign on it saying \u2018beware; electric fence \u2013 do not touch\u2019. However, it\u2019s still in the process of\nbeing erected and isn\u2019t yet attached to any electrical source so you could just climb under or over it. However,\nyour rational mind is telling you \u2018don\u2019t touch it, go round\u2019. A part of you knows you don\u2019t need to do that and is\naware that even if the fence was connected to a power source and switched on, it wouldn\u2019t hurt much anyway.\nHowever, you just can\u2019t bring yourself to touch the fence even though you know it\u2019s not electrified. An almost\nphysical barrier is created which will not allow the hand to move anywhere near the fence \u2013 the hand has\nsurrendered its power to the control of the limited rational, intellectual mind and over-ridden the higherfunctioning, the sub-conscious or intuitional mind.\nMeditation and Yoga Nidra are simple techniques that strengthen the mind and help it to remain centred and\ngrounded in situations such as these. Obviously, these are both extreme situations that most of us don\u2019t normally\nfind ourselves in but they hopefully illustrate the point fairly well. Less dramatic situations which we may find\nourselves in, or may be able to relate to more easily, could be: panicky feelings before interviews, auditions or\npublic-speaking; having to apologise or retract our words; picking up a spider or other animal; eating certain\nfoods or drinking herbal substances we know to be extremely sour or bitter.\nYoga Nidra helps re-educate and strengthen the mind and allows us switch off our lower, limiting conditioned\nreflexes in situations such as these. It allows us to act instantaneously and appropriately without the need to\nweigh up and evaluate every possible outcome. When we are able to do this naturally our lives become peaceful\nand fulfilling and our mind and body remain vital and healthy. We then begin to function at that powerful level\non the very threshold of consciousness where all desires are spontaneously fulfilled.\nOne of the main practices involved during Yoga Nidra is called \u2018rotation of awareness\u2019 during which the mind\nquickly observes different parts of the body. From neuro-physiology we know that each part of the body has a\n\n52\n\n\fdifferent control centre in the brain \u2014curiously, small ones such as the fingers or armpits claim a large brain\narea. The movement of awareness through different parts of the body not only relaxes them, but also clears nerve\npathways to the brain.\nAnother aspect of Yoga Nidra involves alternating opposite awareness of sensations such as heat and cold,\nheaviness and lightness. This aspect helps to improve the body's ability to regain balance and brings the related\ninvoluntary functions under conscious control. Visualization is a method of consciously using a symbol or image\nas a catalyst to provoke a reaction in the unconscious mind. But since no time is given for the conscious mind to\nreact, the mind remains detached and the ego becomes temporarily inactive. This phase helps to resolve\nsuppressed conflicts, desires, memories and sanskaras (karmic tendencies).\n\nThe Practice of Yoga Nidra\nPractice 10-20 minutes of Yoga asanas.\nPractice 10-20 minutes of meditation.\nLie comfortably on your back with your eyes closed, feet apart and palms up. Cover yourself with a blanket to\nkeep warm.\nFirst you will consciously tense and then relax each area of the body starting with the feet and legs. Lift the right\nleg about four inches off the floor. Stretch the toes away from the body and then stretch them towards the head.\nClench the toes tightly. Tense the whole foot and leg and then it relax completely and drop to the floor. Repeat\nthis with the other leg. Lift the right arm about four inches from the floor, clench the fists and then stretch the\nfingers. Tense the hand and arm together and then let it relax completely and drop to the floor. Repeat this with\nthe other arm. Lift and tense the abdomen and then let it completely relax. Lift and tense the chest and then let it\ncompletely relax.

Visualize the part of the body mentioned by the instructor; it can be a\nteacher or a tape-recorder or even your memory once you are familiar with the process.

Remain alert, but do not concentrate.

We therefore have the ability to reverse some of the damage we may have caused due to\nour bad habits, lifestyle choices and poor diet. We can interrupt the process of neglect and decay and replace\nunhealthy molecules, cells and energy patterns with healthy, life-sustaining new ones.\nOnce we begin to relax our mind, control our emotions and cleanse our body; especially the gastro-intestinal\ntract - we begin to experience better health. The colon is intimately connected to all the tissues and organs of the\nbody. This is why the simple process of cleansing the colon can so dramatically affect the whole body and\nrelieve so many of our health issues in such a short period of time.\nPoor lifestyle and dietary choices cause the vital systems of our bodies to become energetically imbalanced, our\nenzymatic activity to decrease and our digestive capacity to be impaired. As a consequence, the food we eat,\nhowever wholesome, is no longer able to provide the tissues with the nutrients they need to repair and maintain\nthemselves and our immune system, nervous system and endocrine system all begin to malfunction.\nIn the short term this may simply result in excess fat, heart irregularities, liver problems, constipation and\nindigestion. However, as more toxic material accumulates, especially on the intestinal wall, malabsorption\nincreases and assimilation and metabolism of nutrients to our cells and deeper tissues are hindered still further.\nThe long term result is chronic illness, low energy, low self-esteem and a disturbed mind. Fortunately Ayurveda\nhas many solutions to these problems; the main one being Panchakarma therapy.\n\nHow we accumulate toxins in the body\nOur bodies are in a constant state of repair and renewal. During this process we naturally produce metabolic\nwaste which must be eliminated effectively in order to stay healthy. We are also exposed to bacteria, viruses and\nother pathogens on a daily basis. As long as our immune and digestive system is strong, healthy and balanced it\nis easily able to cope with this onslaught without any adverse reactions or illnesses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41a22dd2-c8ff-45dd-a614-5a092e5662d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "41a22dd2-c8ff-45dd-a614-5a092e5662d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7b95a95-983d-4029-804d-ad2a7f856a29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a415b013003275ff7eb998852194fa65a8df6bd28e7b7c3a34e046027ffcae51"}, "3": {"node_id": "463cabd7-2201-4e66-a4e2-67eb7456f903", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fffec152e769eca676053e0bf7dfdfeb40c0bab9e2f4d84db1b27c297570ca12"}}, "hash": "122e13989c52e394294ec0cf1329555f53ec12e8327edfe1cefec7bb321bec5b", "text": "However, if we constantly eat devitalised, refined and processed food; breathe polluted air; drink impure liquids;\ntake pharmaceutical drugs; entertain negative thoughts; fail to exercise; work too hard; suffer from stress; sleep\nexcessively; go to bed late; wake late; eat at the wrong time of day and eat foods inappropriate for our body-type,\ntoxins can build up to levels that the body is unable to cope with adequately. We then become tired and\ndepressed and begin to suffer from ill health.\nAs the toxins (ama) build up they begin to solidify and crystallise and interfere with the functioning of the\ntissues. Eventually they cause hardening of the joints, muscles and bones, blocking of the arteries and\nimpairment of the digestive process. Chronic constipation, indigestion, bloating, bad breath, excess weight, water\nretention, fatty deposits, cysts, cellulite, anxiety, heaviness, tiredness, pain in the lower back and joints,\npersistent headaches, varicose veins and other more serious complaints also begin to manifest.\nThe white coating on the tongue each morning gives a good indication of the amount of mental stress and\nphysical toxicity in our tissues. If our digestion is strong and the body is healthy this toxic residue (ama) doesn\u2019t\nappear - a newborn baby\u2019s tongue is pink and lacks the white, toxic coating of many adults today.\nAma is essentially undigested food and the coating on the tongue becomes especially thick and profuse if the\ncolon is functioning poorly. It usually becomes even more noticeable after eating and/or drinking late in the\n\n58\n\n\fevening. At this time of day the body is unable to digest large quantities of food and undigested residues are left\npermeating the bodily tissues. This is one of the main reasons muscles can feel stiff, sore, tired and heavy in the\nmorning; the muscle fibres are literally tangled or \u2018glued\u2019 together by thick, sticky mucus or ama (the same as\nthe coating on the tongue) and they can no longer glide smoothly and freely over each other.\nAs soon as we become aware of dis-harmony in the body, whether it be tiredness, stress, negativity, anger,\nanxiousness, depression or physical symptoms such as nausea, skin rashes, pain or stiffness, we should quickly\ntry and redress the balance by reducing the amount of toxins entering the body whilst also reducing the toxins\nstored in the body. This can only be achieved by changing our diet and lifestyle, increasing our digestive\ncapacity, cleansing our colon and detoxifying our bodily tissues. Just changing our diet or taking a few herbal\nremedies will be unsuccessful, or at least limited in its affect, if we do not also cleanse the body at the same time.\nOnce the digestive system has been purified, balanced and strengthened, the ingestion of pure, unrefined foods\nand the taking of herbal teas and remedies will start to have the desired affect on the areas of the body we\nspecifically wish to improve. Our ultimate goal should be to create constant energy, vitality, lightness, love,\ncompassion and joy which are our inherent birthright and allow us to act efficiently, effectively and\nappropriately at all times; they are also the true measure of a healthy mind and body.\nTo summarise by way of an analogy; perhaps one of the best ways to understand the effects or consequences of\ntoxins in the body is by viewing it in a similar way to a rain barrel. The barrel collects rainwater and as long as\nsome of the water is drawn off regularly it will never overflow and damage the area surrounding it. If we view\nthe human body in a similar way; as long as we don\u2019t ingest and fill the tissues with too many toxins, we can\nflush them from our body before any long-term damage occurs to our vital organs. Furthermore, we are also able\nto increase the size of the barrel itself through the practice of some of Ayurveda\u2019s more subtle healing modalities\nsuch as rejuvenation (rasayana) therapy, gem therapy, colour therapy, mantra therapy, yoga practice, breathing\ntechniques (pranayama) and meditation.\nOn the other hand, if we constantly ingest toxic material over a prolonged period of time the body finally reaches\na point where it is no longer able to process and eliminate them properly and they begin to damage our tissues\nand organs. Our health suffers and we become prone to diseases of the mind and body - the barrel is now\noverflowing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "463cabd7-2201-4e66-a4e2-67eb7456f903": {"__data__": {"id_": "463cabd7-2201-4e66-a4e2-67eb7456f903", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "41a22dd2-c8ff-45dd-a614-5a092e5662d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "122e13989c52e394294ec0cf1329555f53ec12e8327edfe1cefec7bb321bec5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee343fcd-7279-4575-9577-451e470eb4ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "31e7a077438e90f4b4be323c94fc5367fcbd8bddd2475da1757fc10d6b156b2b"}}, "hash": "fffec152e769eca676053e0bf7dfdfeb40c0bab9e2f4d84db1b27c297570ca12", "text": "The longer we ignore the signs and symptoms and refuse to change our ways, the greater the\nlikelihood of a serious chronic problem developing and the harder it becomes to regain control over the problem.\nTwice yearly courses of panchakarma treatments of ten to fourteen days duration help maintain the body in peak\ncondition \u2013 they keep the barrel from overflowing.

It\nrejuvenates and revitalises the mind and body and systematically strengthens and balances all the bodies\u2019 major\ntissues and organs using a wide spectrum of therapeutic measures.\nThe modern trend is to detox the body with herbal concoctions, coffee enemas and colonic irrigation. However, these\nmethods are often only partially successful as they fail to treat the body in an integrated way and only target limited\norgans of the body. They tend to help with the elimination of water-based toxins only and leave the more resistant,\nand potentially disease causing, oil-based toxins behind.\nPanchakarma treatment however, is unique in its ability to effectively eliminate both water-based and oil-based\ntoxins from the body and in doing so helps to rejuvenate and revitalise the whole body. Through a series of\ntherapeutic procedures that are tailored to the client\u2019s individual constitution or imbalance (prakruti) it systematically\nhelps release, melt, loosen, mobilise and eliminate toxins and impurities from all the bodily issues.\nOnce our tissues have been cleansed and our digestive fire has been strengthened, the food and herbs we eat are then\ncapable of being effectively metabolised by the body.

The next step is to gently move waste products and toxins (ama) from where\nthey are lodged in the deeper structures of the body and to eliminate them either through the nose and mouth\n(through nasya & vamana therapy), the gastro-intestinal tract (through enema or basti therapy) or through the pores\nof the skin (through heating or sweating therapy - svedana). Finally, we then need to nourish and strengthen the\nbody. To safely and comfortably flush toxins and impurities from the body requires several important stages.\n\n60\n\n\fThe seven stages of a panchakarma detox\nrejuvenation program\nStage one \u2013 palliation (shamana)\nIn order to rebalance the mind and body with these powerfully relaxing and luxurious panchakarma therapies\nthe digestive system needs to be functioning properly and the tissues need to be cleansed of accumulated\nmetabolic waste (ama). This is achieved by following a light, easily digestible diet for a period of at least one\nweek before the main treatment program begins. Herbal digestive stimulants are usually given to enhance this\nprocess and to spark the digestive fire (agni). This pre-detox diet necessitates avoiding heavy foods such as\nmeat and dairy and eating only light food such as rice, vegetables and lentils (dhal).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee343fcd-7279-4575-9577-451e470eb4ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee343fcd-7279-4575-9577-451e470eb4ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "463cabd7-2201-4e66-a4e2-67eb7456f903", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fffec152e769eca676053e0bf7dfdfeb40c0bab9e2f4d84db1b27c297570ca12"}, "3": {"node_id": "2876f89c-82b8-416f-8988-a13b4ec54956", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1260cc43804ddf0b35c81ee6aa38546295d7806dba5addf70423c0afdafe12b1"}}, "hash": "31e7a077438e90f4b4be323c94fc5367fcbd8bddd2475da1757fc10d6b156b2b", "text": "Light exercise, walking in\nthe fresh air, meditation and yoga are also indicated. Contra-indications during the seven stages of the\nPanchakarma program include: anger, excessive talking, shouting, travelling, sleeping during day, sitting too\nlong, over-eating, eating before previous meal is digested, unwholesome diet, coitus, excessive exercise, sun\nbathing, swimming, extreme heat, extreme cold, windy weather, cold baths and cold drinks.\n\nStage two \u2013 pre-treatment (purvakarma)\nPurvakarma involves ingesting a fatty agent (snehana) such as ghee (clarified butter) for several days in order to\ngradually penetrate all seven bodily tissues and release their stored toxins.\nDay 1: Cleanses the colon of ama and mala (waste)\nDay 2: Balances and nourishes the vata areas of the body and calms the mind\nDay 3: Balances and nourishes the pitta areas, especially the blood (rakta) and lymph (rasa)\nDay 4: Draws toxins from the kapha areas of the body, especially the muscle tissue (mamsa)\nDay 5: Draws toxins from the kapha areas of the body especially the adipose/fat tissue (meda)\nDay 6: Draws toxins from bone tissue and balances vata (asthi)\nDay 7: Draws toxins from the bone marrow and nerve tissue and balances vata (majja)\nDay 8: Draws toxins from the reproductive tissue (semen/ovum - shukra)\nThe snehana substance is taken early in the morning and replaces breakfast. We then eat only when this has\nbeen fully digested \u2013 this may be anything from six to twelve hours depending on the amount consumed.\nDuring this phase of the detox it is important for us to eat only when we are properly hungry \u2013 often we\nexperience a \u2018false\u2019 hunger which can be eased by sipping hot water.\nMeanwhile, eating a light diet, low in fat and calories helps break down and release stored body fat and also\nallows impurities within the fat cells to become more concentrated. Because the ingested ghee that is\ncirculating in the bloodstream is free of toxins and impurities it exerts an osmotic pressure and draws the toxins\nfrom the tissue cells and carries them to the liver and intestines. Light, herbalised oil massage, hot baths and\nsteam or sweating therapy (svedana) during this time help increase blood flow and allow toxins to be released\nand directed towards the liver and small intestine more effectively. These preparatory measures, whilst ensuring\nthat the body's channels are open so that toxins can move out, also ensure that nutritive substances can move\ninto the tissues (dhatus). The body is now soft, smooth, light and fluid and adequately prepared for virechana,\nthe next stage of the Panchakarma procedure.\nNote on ghee: this highly nutritious a food source contains an excellent balance of health giving fatty acids. It is\nvery low in polyunsaturated fat, moderate in monounsaturated fat and is also a good source of vitamins A, D, E,\nand K. It has anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties due to its linoleic acid content.\n\n61\n\n\fStage three - purgation (virechana)\nVirechana is an orally administered, herb-induced purgative treatment that moves acidic secretions and\nimpurities (ama) from the pitta regions (mainly the blood, liver, gall-bladder and small intestines) to the rectum.\nThere are many herbs that may be used for this treatment but castor oil is often the purgative of choice as it is\nrelatively mild and produces the desired affect in most healthy adults. Any physical or mental activity, which\nwould draw energy away from the gastrointestinal tract, is contraindicated during this process as this severely\nlimits its cleansing effects.\nIt is usually administered very early in the morning, or during pitta time when pitta-related ama naturally\naccumulates in the pitta regions. If virechana is administered in the late evening, it is taken two to three hours\nafter a light meal. The meal should be relatively hot, spicy and sour tasting as these tastes help promote pittarelated secretions. By late evening the meal will have reached the small intestine and will therefore allow the\nherbal stimulus to exert its cleansing influence on the pitta organs and tissues.\nAfter ingesting the purgative there follows a series of three to fifteen loose bowel movements a few hours later.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2876f89c-82b8-416f-8988-a13b4ec54956": {"__data__": {"id_": "2876f89c-82b8-416f-8988-a13b4ec54956", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee343fcd-7279-4575-9577-451e470eb4ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "31e7a077438e90f4b4be323c94fc5367fcbd8bddd2475da1757fc10d6b156b2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "87e1a842-fa9b-4823-86ca-d2f08c381dda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6dca26a22247b86494484f4a9de7fdf69736898ae3f3f4b0cdd503878f40ea58"}}, "hash": "1260cc43804ddf0b35c81ee6aa38546295d7806dba5addf70423c0afdafe12b1", "text": "The number of movements varies depending on the client\u2019s Ayurvedic constitution and the amount of ama\npresent in the pitta region of the body. The fecal matter is usually fairly solid at first, but progressively softens\nuntil it is entirely liquid. Mild cramping or burning sensations occasionally occur due to pitta-related ama being\nexpelled. This can be counteracted by ingesting a small amount of ghee.\nIf there are less than three or four bowel movements this indicates that ama was not fully eliminated from the\nsmall intestine and virechana therapy needs repeating. If cleansing is incomplete there may sometimes be\nfeelings of bloating or hardness in the abdomen, itching on the skin, a metallic taste in the mouth, or nausea in\nthe stomach due to the retention of gas, feces, toxins and waste products in the small intestines. Ginger tea will\nhelp reduce these sensations as will a warm hot-water bottle over the abdomen. Once the bowel movements\nbecome completely liquid they may contain some mucus. This indicates that the small intestine has been\nemptied and mucus from the stomach and the kapha areas of the body is starting to come out. Once all the ama,\nwaste material and toxins have been expelled from the small intestine the purging process ceases and the urge to\nevacuate naturally subsides. The body now feels stronger, clearer and revitalized.\nFollowing completion of virechana chamomile or licorice tea is drunk to soothe the intestinal tract and rest is\ntaken in a warm, relaxed environment. Exercise and sexual activity is contra-indicated and a light diet of rice\nwater and rice and lentil soup is followed for several days or until full digestive strength returns. It is very\nimportant at this stage not to eat or drink anything cold as this will shrink the bodily channels, aggravate vata\nand tax an already weakened digestive fire.\nAfter a successful virechana digestion improves, appetite increases, abdominal bloating and heaviness\ndisappear, the mind feels calm and clear, skin inflammation clears and the body feels clean, strong and vital.\nVirechana therapy promotes metabolism and assimilation by enkindling the digestive fires of all the tissues\n(dhatus) whilst simultaneously cleansing waste products and burning ama. It is excellent for all pitta-related\ndisorders such as malabsorption, acne, dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, leprosy, leukoderma, hyperacidity, colitis,\nurticaria, hemorrhoids, headaches, migraine and allergies. It also reduces excessive body heat and acidity,\ndeeply cleanses the blood, liver and bile, promotes clarity of mind, sharpens the sense organs, strengthens and\nrejuvenates bodily tissues and improves digestion. It is excellent for persons suffering from gout, fever, skin\ndiseases, hematemesis, hemorrhoids, anemia, worms, headaches, chest pains, burning eyes, cataracts, asthma,\njaundice, epilepsy, ascitis, lactation, disorders of the bones and joints and gynecological disorders.\n\n62\n\n\fStage four \u2013 graduated diet (samsarjana krama)\nVirechana treatment temporarily lowers the digestive fire as ama is drawn back into the digestive tract and then\nexpelled from the body. As weak digestion creates the potential for disease to arise in the first place, it is of\nutmost importance that digestion is strengthened at the conclusion of virechana.\nIn order to re-establish full digestive capacity and prevent the formation of new ama the diet following\nvirechana must be very light to begin with, and only very gradually increase in heaviness over the following\nfew days. Only if this procedure is followed properly will digestive strength be maximized, food and medicine\nproperly digested, absorbed and assimilated and immunity from disease be accomplished.\nThe diet following virechana therefore starts with one or two very easily digested meals of rice water (Peya).\nThis is followed by one or two meals of a slightly thicker gruel or watery rice soup called Vilepi. Finally a\nthicker soup of rice, lentils, herbs and spices is taken. A little ghee, black salt and jaggary is added to the first\nfew preparations with fresh ginger, turmeric, cumin, coriander and fennel added in the later preparations to\nenkindle the digestive fire.\nThe final preparation of rice and lentils is called Kichari and this diet is adhered to throughout the whole course\nof Panchakarma treatments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87e1a842-fa9b-4823-86ca-d2f08c381dda": {"__data__": {"id_": "87e1a842-fa9b-4823-86ca-d2f08c381dda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "2876f89c-82b8-416f-8988-a13b4ec54956", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1260cc43804ddf0b35c81ee6aa38546295d7806dba5addf70423c0afdafe12b1"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e59a25f-f4b7-4951-8e0f-2f0ce19fd4c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9e093e0c7f4336a662117d657cb40127aeea47d21fb6799a8ddea496ff8beed"}}, "hash": "6dca26a22247b86494484f4a9de7fdf69736898ae3f3f4b0cdd503878f40ea58", "text": "Kichari is very nourishing, easy to digest, provides complete and balanced\nnutrition, and is suitable for all types of constitution as it balances all three doshas. It strengthens all seven\ntissues (dhatus) and aids the detoxification process. It is therefore also recommended during any period of\nillness, detoxification or rejuvenation process. The length of time spent on this diet depends on digestive\ncapacity and is usually determined by the inherent Ayurvedic constitution.\nThe strength of our appetite is of key importance during this process. Only if it is strong are we are ready to eat,\nas a strong appetite is our body's signal that digestion, assimilation and elimination are working well. Those of\na pitta constitution may find their digestion is back to full strength after only three light meals, while a person of\na kapha constitution may find their digestion isn\u2019t back to full strength until after ten light meals have been\ntaken. Drinking freshly grated, ginger root tea and cumin seeds will also help restore the appetite.\nWhen a graduating diet is followed in this way after virechana the digestive fire (agni) is slowly built up,\nenabling it to become strong and powerful. The process is similar to the steps necessary to build a bonfire. It is\nstarted using paper, dried grass and twigs and only when it is burning brightly are larger pieces of wood added.\nIt is then gradually built up using progressively larger pieces of wood. Once the fire is burning at full strength it\nwill burn, and reduce to fine ashes, almost anything that is added to it.\nOnce our appetite it is back to normal we should ensure that we follow the usual Ayurvedic recommendations\nfor maintaining a strong and healthy digestion. This includes; eating only when hungry, eating until sated and\nnot until the stomach feels full and heavy, eating the largest meal at mid-day, eating a light meal in the early\nevening, avoiding snacking between meals, not drinking cold drinks (especially with meals), eating in a calm\nenvironment, avoiding heavy, fried foods and fasting for a day once or twice a month.\n\n63\n\n\fStage five: enema (basti) therapy\nVirechana is followed by basti which is the main treatment for nourishing and balancing vata and also for\nflushing impurities from the colon. This is a very powerful therapy and Ayurvedic texts state that over 50% of\ndiseases can be resolved by this procedure alone. During basti, herbal preparations are administered into\nthe colon via the rectum. However, unlike modern enema therapies, its effect is nutritive and energy\nbalancing rather than simply cleansing. Due to the preparatory treatments given beforehand, basti\nindirectly affects all the other bodily organs and tissues, as the colon is linked to and nourishes,\nsupports and sustains all areas of the body.\nThe colon is not only the main organ concerned with the absorption of nutrients and the elimination\nof waste material but it is also the main seat of vata, the primary energy that governs all physiological\nactivities in the body. When vata is functioning normally its movement facilitates the removal of\nimpurities, toxins and waste matter from the tissues and helps eliminate them from the body. By\nbalancing the energy of vata through basti we are able to control the onset of disease as we prevent\ntoxins (ama) from being carried from the gastrointestinal tract into the deeper tissues where they can\ngenerate disease.\nBasti therapy is used to treat vata disorders such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,\nmultiple sclerosis, muscular-dystrophy, constipation, low back pain, sciatica, rheumatism, arthritis, gout,\nepilepsy and mental fatigue.\nThe first basti to be administered is the Anuwasan or oil based enema. It is nourishing and balancing to\nvata and also lubricates, nourishes and strengthens the tissues (dhatus) of the body. As this is a\nrelatively small enema (matra basti) it is often retained in the body for over three hours and people\nwith particularly dry colons will often absorb much of the oil. They are usually administered before\nand after the eliminating bastis (niruha or shodhana) as they counteract the more depleting nature of\nthis powerful purification therapy. Oil based bastis are good for treating problems relating to muscles,\nbone, bone marrow and nerve tissue and are often prescribed for chronic neuromuscular disorders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e59a25f-f4b7-4951-8e0f-2f0ce19fd4c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e59a25f-f4b7-4951-8e0f-2f0ce19fd4c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "87e1a842-fa9b-4823-86ca-d2f08c381dda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6dca26a22247b86494484f4a9de7fdf69736898ae3f3f4b0cdd503878f40ea58"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ff3478b-0095-4d84-aa24-1781663e1305", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "534edf2f111a975a102f8d94eb3395e012cb3b7d7b53047b8bdfc24d88cc8084"}}, "hash": "b9e093e0c7f4336a662117d657cb40127aeea47d21fb6799a8ddea496ff8beed", "text": "The second basti administered during a Panchakarma detox is an eliminating water-based enema called a\nshodhana or niruha basti.

Thus, the best time to take these powerful herbal formulas is after a course of Panchakarma\ntreatments when the body has been cleansed and the digestion is functioning optimally.

Rasayana formulas may be\ntaken for several months and the specific formulas chosen will depend on your predominant Ayurvedic bodytype or the energy, tissue, system or organ of the body that needs to be strengthened and balanced.\nThere are many traditional rasayanas; some nourish the tissues, some are rejuvenating, some strengthen the\nimmune system, some increase strength, vitality and stamina, some balance the nervous system and some\nstrengthen the reproductive system.

This ensures that the delicate state of the nervous system at this time is\nnot over-stimulated, the tissues are able to re-build themselves properly and energy levels rise sufficiently to\ncope with the increase in metabolism necessary for everyday activities. Failing to do this can lead to a drain in\nenergy levels and an increased strain on the immune system \u2013 and we end up feeling worse than we did before.\nIt is also important that we follow the \u2018Ideal Daily Routine\u2019 of waking, sleeping, eating at the proper times,\nconsuming the right foods for our body-type and integrating exercise, yoga, massage, herbal teas and meditation\ninto our daily program. If we finish a ten or fourteen-day detox and then jump straight on the plane or into a\nstressful office or domestic situation we halt the delicate process of renewal and revitalization before it has had\nchance to fully carry out it\u2019s re-integration phase. We then wonder why we feel so tired and become prone to\ncolds and flu more easily, rather than feel energized and healthy. Once we fully understand the profound power\nof Ayurveda, and especially panchakarma, we take the time to complete the process fully and thereby transform\nour physiological and psychological resources into storehouses of immense strength and resilience.\nIdeally, after panchakarma, we should take at least a week to progress slowly back into our normal daily routine\nbefore we face the world head on again, just the same as we would take a little time to adjust to the day ahead\nafter waking from a deep sleep or when coming out of a profoundly peaceful meditation. For panchakarma to\nbe successful we need time to assimilate the benefits and regain our energy levels \u2013 we should avoid undue\nmental and physical stress, late nights, excessive travel, strenuous exercise, prolonged sunbathing, cold water,\ncold or rainy weather and sexual activity for a least a week following the last treatment. If these guidelines are\ndiligently applied we support and enhance the effects of the panchakarma therapies and assist the body in\nconcentrating its energy on complete rejuvenation and revitalisation.\nWe should also follow a light, nutritious, vegetarian diet of pulses, grains, fruits and vegetables to ensure that\ndigestive system is restored to maximum efficiency and able to eliminate toxins from the body. Once the\ndigestion is working at full strength the food we eat will be properly digested, assimilated and metabolised.\nThis will ensure that metabolic toxins, ama and fat are not deposited within the body. We can then be confident\nthat we are doing our best to remain relatively free from future disease or illness and will be better equipped to\nenjoy life to the full with optimal health, joy and vitality.\nFinally it should be noted that while Panchakarma may be very successful in alleviating symptoms of disease,\nits real goal is to eliminate their cause. An absence of symptoms does not necessarily indicate a complete cure symptoms of disease can often be eliminated or subdued but a complete cure often takes much longer. It is\ngenerally accepted that if a person\u2019s disease has been slowly manifesting over a number of years it will take at\nleast the same amount of time to completely reverse the damage done and obtain complete relief. To effect real\nlong-lasting change the person must also review and alter diet, lifestyle, stress levels and negative mental\nattitudes, behaviour and emotions in order to eradicate the core and true cause of his illness.\n\n66\n\n\fFoods to avoid on a panchakarma detox\n\nIt is important to avoid the following foods, drinks and condiments during the detox program. They have the\npotential to jeopardise your health when your digestive system is undergoing detoxification. They are hard for\nthe body to digest when the system is attempting to flush out toxins (metabolic waste).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c46b1b24-113d-4fae-bf31-8fed8db6bbb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c46b1b24-113d-4fae-bf31-8fed8db6bbb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ff3478b-0095-4d84-aa24-1781663e1305", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "534edf2f111a975a102f8d94eb3395e012cb3b7d7b53047b8bdfc24d88cc8084"}, "3": {"node_id": "a833403a-f617-4c90-868d-378d1f860c3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca6e5ce0362f756cb6e7e043039917b0c4f231961596ec43df6fc5c860366471"}}, "hash": "696fd61eb97cbf1c4351a206e7fee7454e3142365b3d3b8a0a47a6aef103ed44", "text": "Bottled drinks\nCanned drinks\nConfectionary\nDeep-fried food\n\nFrozen food\nLeft-over food\nMicrowaved food\nProcessed food\n\nRefined food\nTinned food\nUncooked food\nYeast products\n\nAlcohol\nCarbonated drinks\n\nCoffee\nMilk\n\nPasteurised juices\nTea\n\nCitrus\nDairy\nFish\nMeat\n\nSeafood\nSour fruit\nSalads\nWhole nuts\n\nUn-ground seeds\nVery hot spices\nSoya/tofu\nYoghurt\n\nAvocado\nBananas\nBrussels sprouts\nCabbage\nCauliflower\nChillies\n\nLettuce\nGarlic\nHorseradish\nHot peppers\nMelons\nMushrooms\n\nOlives\nOnions/leeks\nPotatoes\nParsnips\nTurnips\nTomatoes\n\nKetchup\nMayonnaise\nSoya sauce\nBrown rice\n\nTamarind sauce\nSalad cream\nSugar\nPasta\n\nSalt (in excess)\nPickles\nVinegar\nBread\n\n67\n\n\fPre & post-treatment meal routines\nPre \u2013 detox recommendations: twelve days before a panchakarma detox it is beneficial to start\ngraduating towards a light diet as this gives the digestive system a rest and starts the process of cleansing\nthe body of toxins and accumulated metabolic waste.

It pacifies all seven\ndhatus and promotes metabolism and assimilation by enkindling the digestive fires of all the tissues whilst\nsimultaneously cleansing waste products or burning ama. It should not be used in cases of diverticulitis,\nulcerative colitis, diarrhoea, Crohn's disease and pregnancy.\nCastor oil is vata and pitta pacifying and thus helps improve the condition and strength of nerve tissue. It\nincreases intellect, promotes clarity of mind and induces calmness while also acting as a topical analgesic\nfor neuralgia and sciatica. One or two drops placed in the eyes at night will help with conjunctivitis and\nsties.\nCastor oil applied to the skin is rejuvenating and helps heal bruises. A paste made from castor oil and\nbaking soda is good for moles and warts and a castor oil, ghee and neem powder mix (ratio of 4:4:1) helps\nwith cases of eczema, fungal infection and herpes zoster. It improves complexion by pacifying pitta\ndosha and, used during massage, is excellent for gout, lumbago, stiffness, aches and strains. As a remedy\nfor hiccups an equal mix of honey and castor oil is made and \u00bc teaspoon taken every 15 seconds for two\nto three minutes. Castor oil packs or compresses on the abdomen will help tone and strengthen the colon\nand reduce soreness or swelling and promote menstrual flow. Castor oil mixed with flax oil and mustard\noil may be used to massage mastic tissue to reduce fibrocystic accumulations. Castor oil massaged into\nthe perineum is good for prostate or cervical problems.\nIngesting castor oil after childbirth facilitates the production of breast milk. For problems relating to the\njoints taking two teaspoons of Castor oil with ginger tea at night will help release toxins and promote\nstrength and flexibility. It will help remove ama and improve the functioning of the colon and, as it is\nthrough this organ that the minerals vital to the nourishment of bone tissue (asthi dhatu) are absorbed, it\nwill help rectify disorders related to the skeletal system.\nTo improve digestion, maintain a healthy colon and maximize the assimilation and metabolism of\nnutrients to the tissues it is recommended that, once every three months, the colon is cleansed using a\nstrong purgative \u2013 castor oil fulfils this role. It clears accumulated mucus, waste and toxins from the\nintestinal tract by promoting strong peristaltic movements followed by a series of loose bowel movements\nover the next few hours.\nInstructions for taking castor oil:\n\u2022 Warm 30mls of castor oil (by immersing the container in hot water or by placing on a radiator).\n\u2022 Take a hot bath at 7am \u2013 make sure the head is kept cool.\n\u2022 Drink the castor oil and then suck on a piece of orange, lemon or lime to prevent nausea and take\naway any lingering taste. Drink plenty of ginger tea until you have the urge to eliminate.\n\u2022 Elimination will usually happen in 1-4 hours (usually 3-10 movements). Stop taking liquids for\nthe next hour.\n\u2022 Do not eat until you feel hunger and then have a watery rice soup only for the first meal. The\nevening meal should be a thicker rice soup and the meals on the following day should be dhal\nsoup (kicharee).\n\n69\n\n\fGhee\nGhee is cow\u2019s butter from which the water and milk solids have been removed and can be used for frying herbs,\nsaut\u00e9ing vegetables and spreading on toast.

It pacifies all three doshas, strengthens and protects bodily tissue, improves memory, increases\nmental clarity, promotes stamina, stimulates digestion, produces a healthy complexion and aids rejuvenation and\nlongevity. If taken in moderation (1-2 tsp) with each meal it enhances the digestive process but over two tablespoons\nper day, especially for a Kapha body type, will clog the system and subdue the digestive fire.

Scientific research has shown that some fatty acids are in fact very beneficial for the\nbody while others are absolutely essential. Fats can be saturated or unsaturated. Saturated fats contain either longchain or short-chain fatty acids. Long-chain fatty acids may not be totally digested and metabolised by the body and\nfrequent digestion of products which contain them, primarily meat and dairy may, in the long term, lead to excess\nacidity in the body which can result in cancer, arthritis, rheumatism and thrombosis. However, short-chain fatty acids\nare digested, assimilated, absorbed, and metabolised very easily and help the body release energy.\nSimilarly, unsaturated fatty acids, are either monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Monounsaturated fats are very\nhealthy while the polyunsaturated are not. This is due to the kind of chemical bonds these fats form - monounsaturated\nfats form single bonds and polyunsaturated fats form multiple bonds and this is where oxidation takes place during\nheating or processing causing the fat to become toxic. Foods fried in polyunsaturated fatty acids (sunflower,\ncornflower etc) become oxidized and toxic; they lose electrons (free radicals) and change the chemical structure of the\noil. These free radicals are believed to be the primary cause of most cancers and chronic diseases prevalent in the\nworld today. As the majority of vegetable oils contain predominantly polyunsaturated fatty acids it is not advisable to\nuse them for cooking. Sesame oil, ghee and coconut are an exception as they contain powerful antioxidants and\ndoesn\u2019t become toxic on heating.\nMargarine is particularly unhealthy as it is hydrogenated and contains a large percentage of trans-fatty acids. These\nacids, which are chemically altered during processing, are synthetic; they do not occur in a natural form and are\ntherefore unrecognisable to the body. They have been shown to be associated with heart disease and to increase lowdensity lipoprotein (the bad cholesterol) just as saturated fats do. However, predominantly monounsaturated fatty\nacids, such as olive oil, mustard oil, canola oil, and rapeseed oil are associated with the prevention of many diseases\nincluding heart disease and cancer. Ghee contains 25% monounsaturated fatty acids and only 5% polyunsaturated fatty\nacids. It contains saturated fats but most of these are short-chain fatty acids with only 10% long-chain fatty acids. As a\nhealthy diet requires and a consumption of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, ghee is excellent as part of our\ndaily diet as it contains around 65% saturated fats, most of which are short-chain fatty acids. Ghee is a good source of\nvitamins A, D, E, and K whilst also having anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties perhaps due to its linoleic acid\ncontent.\nInstructions for ingesting ghee as part of a Panchakarma detox (only if instructed by your Ayurvedic practitioner):\n\u2022 Take a hot bath at 7am.\n\u2022 Melt the ghee (30mls etc) by placing on a radiator or in hot water until fully liquid.\n\u2022 Drink the ghee and then suck on an orange segment to take away the residual taste if desired.\n\u2022 If you feel very nauseous or have very loose bowel movements soon after taking the ghee do not take the\nnext day\u2019s ghee and have a day of rest instead.\n\u2022 Drink fennel, vata or barley tea to enhance the detoxification process and ease any feelings of discomfort.\n\n70\n\n\fMaintaining good health\nAfter Panchakarma therapy our digestion is stronger, the mind is less tired and stressed, the immune\nsystem is better able to cope with the demands placed on it and our energy levels are increased.

Also, the more subtle tissues support the grosser tissues and store their concentrated\nenergy. Thus blood is concentrated plasma, muscle is concentrated blood and fat is concentrated muscle.\nThe grosser tissues (plasma, blood and muscle) are larger in quantity as only a portion of each is\nconverted into the next more subtle tissue, with reproductive tissue being the subtlest and most\nconcentrated and enduring. It takes thirty-five days for the food we eat to work its way through the seven\ntissues to become reproductive tissue. As reproductive tissue is the essence of our life-energy and upholds\nall the other tissues we need to be extra careful that this tissue doesn\u2019t become depleted.\nPlasma (rasa): This tissue is composed mainly of water and is that which all the other tissues of the\nbody are suspended. When properly maintained it helps nourish all the other tissues in the body,\nproviding adequate hydration and electrolyte balance. It is the container for kapha in the body and its\nmain sites are the skin, heart, blood vessels, lymphatic system and mucus membranes. When there is an\nexcess of plasma, kapha increases and we become prone to accumulations of saliva and phlegm, loss of\nappetite, nausea, congestion, cysts and benign tumours. When plasma is deficient we are more prone to\nrough skin, cracked, dry lips, dehydration, lethargy, tremors, palpitations, pain and feelings of emptiness.\nIf we maintain plasma in an optimal state we have a healthy, glowing complexion with soft, smooth skin\nand luxurious, shining hair. Balanced plasma tissue creates vitality, stamina, compassion, contentment,\npleasure and a happy disposition generally. It can be strengthened by drinking adequate amounts of\nliquid, especially fruit and vegetable juices and in particular lemon and lime juice with a little salt.\nOrganic dairy products and particularly organic, unpasturised milk is also good.\nBlood (rakta): This tissue is composed of fire and water and provides oxygen to the tissue cells. It is\nthe container for pitta in the body. Excess blood creates skin diseases, abscesses, fevers, inflammation,\nbleeding disorders, enlarged liver and spleen, hypertension, jaundice, weak digestion and burning or\nredness in the eyes, skin and urine. Deficient states cause pallor, low blood pressure, rough, dry skin and\ndesire for cold, sour food. In its optimal state is gives rise to a healthy glowing complexion and warm\nskin, clearness in the eyes, vitality, love, faith and a passion for life. It can be strengthened through eating\niron-rich foods such as black grapes, molasses, carrots and beetroot.\nMuscle (mamsa): This is a heavy, predominately kapha tissue and makes up much of the bulk of the\nbody \u2013 it is composed primarily of the earth element and serves to bind it together whilst giving it\nstrength for action. In excess it creates swelling or tumours in the muscles, heaviness and swelling in the\nglands, obesity, enlarged liver, irritability and anger. It can also impair sexual vitality and cause fibroids\nand miscarriage in women. When deficient it creates emaciation, fatigue, lack of co-ordination, fear,\ninsecurity and unhappiness. In its optimal state we have good muscle development and co-ordination,\nmental and physical strength, courage, confidence, openness, forgiveness and integrity. Muscle is fortified\nwith proteins from grains, beans, nuts and meat.\n\n75\n\n\fFat (meda):\nThis is another kapha tissue which is composed mainly of water but is more refined\ntype than plasma.

In excess it also leads to fatigue, asthma, sexual debility,\nextreme thirst, hypertension, diabetes, sagging breasts, belly and thighs and lack of mobility.

When in balance, we have a sense of fulfillment and\ncompassion in life, the mind is clear, sharp and sensitive, memory is strong and the senses are acute and\nperceptive. Also, the eyes are large and clear, the joints are strong, pain threshold is high and speech is\nstrong. It is best maintained through the oils of butter, ghee, nuts and seeds.\nReproductive tissue (shukra):\nThis is again a kapha tissue and is the essential or causal form of\nwater \u2013 it has the power to create new life. In excess we are prone to anger and unhealthy sexual desires,\nsemen stones, inflammation of the prostrate and cysts in the ovaries and uterus. A deficiency leads to lack\nof vigour, lack of sexual desire, impotence, dry mouth, lower back pain, lack of vaginal lubrication and\nslow, difficult ejaculation. Emotionally there can be fear, anxiety and a lack of love and compassion.\nWhen in balance the eyes are clear, the hair is lustrous and strong, sexual organs are well formed, the\nbody is attractive and we exude a loving, charming, compassionate nature. This tissue is maintained\nthrough taking milk, raw sugar, ghee, nuts, seeds and eggs.\n\n76\n\n\fPanchakarma - FAQ\nWhy do I need to eat a light vegetarian diet during my detox?\nA light vegetarian diet allows your body to detox more efficiently and effectively. Your digestive system uses a\nlarge amount of energy when it has heavy foods to break down and digest. If less energy is spent on digesting food\nthere is more energy available to release metabolic wastes and toxins from your body. Animal products are very\ndifficult to digest and are therefore strictly contra-indicated during a detox.\nWhy is it important to also follow a light diet before and after my detox?\nA light diet before a detox helps prepare the body for the elimination of impurities. It ensures the body has energy\navailable to thoroughly detox the body, which naturally begins clearing our waste products once conditions are\nfavourable. It also ensures that the detox progresses smoothly and effectively without shocking the body and causing\na \u2018healing crisis\u2019 (a reaction to excessive toxins being released into the bloodstream and causing the liver to struggle\nto eliminate them properly). After a detox a light diet is important because it helps the digestive system gain strength\nand efficiency as it gradually increases its digestive capacity.\nWhy are rice and dhal so beneficial during a detox?\nRice and dhal are light and nutritious and are very easily digested. They take only small amounts of energy to be\nmetabolised which allows your body to have the energy it requires to detox efficiently and effectively.\nWhy do I need to take ghee during the Panchakarma detox?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2023dde-692c-41cb-bf8b-204ffd9e6c99": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2023dde-692c-41cb-bf8b-204ffd9e6c99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bc10708-0b80-4b64-b4b9-f661cee8e316", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d03ec33d742372042fd23a6a44bc01634e28a2e8b830f9b15c1989eb91be011b"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0fa5f38-f453-4576-a358-3b00a44cc9ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d51e8dee89af77d15be8b966f45f5d92ebb1af276672b4ea7135b128b0abd7b0"}}, "hash": "82c6fbd9d60f74ccfa04f00b949165d9211cfd2a934d11394d27e7ef02ea9493", "text": "Why do I need to take ghee during the Panchakarma detox?\nGhee is similar in quality to the fat in your body. However, it has one the main difference; it has no has no toxins or\nimpurities stored in it. As toxins gradually build up in your fat tissues they become increasingly more likely to cause\nchronic health conditions. However, the ghee circulating in your bloodstream during the early stages of the detox\ngradually draws them out ready for elimination.\nWon\u2019t the ghee raise cholesterol and make me fat?\nNo, quite the contrary. Taken in small amounts, especially as part of a panchakarma detox procedure, it will help\nreduce the \u2018bad\u2019 fat stored in your body and will therefore lead to weight loss rather than weight gain.\nWhy is ghee taken very early in the morning?\nDuring the early morning your metabolism is very slow and sluggish so the ghee is digested very slowly. It stays\ncirculating in the bloodstream for longer than it normally would and is therefore able to absorb toxins from the fat in\nyour deeper tissues.\nWhy do I need to take castor oil during the Panchakarma detox?\nCastor oil has a stimulating or \u2018contracting\u2019 effect on the colon and helps induce peristalsis \u2013 it therefore helps\neliminate the toxins and metabolic wastes that have been drawn from the deeper tissues by the action of the ghee. It\nalso cools and purifies the blood and liver and helps eliminate excess Pitta (heat or acidity) from the body.\nWhy do I need to take Trikatu or Ginger Pickle before meals?\nTrikatu and Ginger pickle are digestive aids that promote the production of digestive enzymes in your stomach \u2013\nthey enkindle the agni (digestive fire) and ensure that the food you consume is fully digested. Trikatu is also very\neffective for burning ama (metabolic waste and toxins) which is the prime cause of all disease.\nWhy do I need to take Triphala at bedtime?\nTriphala is an Ayurvedic herbal formula composed of three fruits (Haritaki, Bibhitaki and Amalaki). Together they\nhelp tone and strengthen your digestive tract and promote regular and complete evacuation of the bowels. They also\nhelp increase the digestion, absorption and assimilation of nutrients from the food you consume.\nWhy is it important to drink hot water during a detox?\nHot water in your body acts in a similar way to hot water applied to your greasy pots and pans \u2013 it helps loosen and\ndissolve the dirt or impurities and melts the fatty deposits. When it is combined with digestive herbs and fresh lemon\njuice it has an even stronger action. However, cold water will cause the fat in your body to congeal and harden and\nwill therefore result in a lowering of your digestive power, increased deposits of fat in your body and excess weight.\n\n77\n\n\fWhy are bastis (enemas) so important to the success of the Panchakarma detox?\nThe ancient Ayurvedic texts state that bastis or herbal enemas account for over 50% of the overall effectiveness of\nthe whole Panchakarma detox procedure. They nourish the colon and deeper tissues (bone and nerves) and help\neliminate toxins and metabolic wastes from the body. They not only release toxins from, but also penetrate and\nnourish, the lymph, blood, muscle, fat, bone, nerve and reproductive tissue. They cleanse and strengthen the entire\nendocrine, digestive and immune system and thereby cut off disease at its source.\nWhat is Rasayana therapy?\nRasayana therapy is undertaken after your Panchakarma detox treatments to rejuvenate the whole body. After your\ntissues and digestive tract have been cleansed your physiology is in a more pure and receptive state for herbal\npreparations to nourish and strengthen your deeper tissues and organs. There are many Rasayana formulas but three\nof the most common are Ashwagandha, Shatavari and Chywanaprash and these are often recommended after a\ncourse of detox treatments.\nWhat is the purpose of the Ayurvedic massage therapies?\nTheir primary purpose is to nourish and cleanse the deeper tissues through the application of specialised herbs and\noils.

However,\nthe body will only release deeper-seated toxins once it is in a relaxed state and this is accomplished through the\nlighter massage therapies.\nWhy can\u2019t Ayurvedic massage therapies be administered in the evening?\nMassage therapies are contra-indicated in the evening because your body is in a very sensitive, vulnerable and\ndelicate stage at this time of day \u2013 this is especially so if you are undergoing intensive detox treatments. During\ndaylight hours massage therapy facilitates the generation and release of energy into your body. However, massage\nadministered in the evening causes energy to be lost from your body \u2013 it depletes your body of vital nutrients and\nlowers the immune system. Furthermore, if massage therapy is administered after eating, or before eating, your\nevening meal it will interfere with your digestive system and will cause ama (metabolic waste) and toxins to be\ncreated. The person carrying out your massage therapy also suffers in a similar way. Their digestive system will be\ncompromised and they will suffer from a lack of energy and a build up of toxins the following day. This will\nadversely affect the success of your detox treatments as your own energy will be drained as a result.\nWhy can\u2019t I have massage treatments during the morning of my castor oil detox?\nMassage therapy administered during the hours following purgation therapy with castor oil are contra-indicated\nbecause they will interfere with the detoxing that the castor oil has induced in your tissues. The detox process carries\non for many hours, even after elimination has ceased, and it should be allowed to come to its natural conclusion for\nmaximum benefits. Also, the digestive fire is very weak at this time and even though the oil is applied to the skin, it\npenetrates to the deeper tissues and needs to be digested.\nWhy should I refrain from mental or physical activity (including sex) during my detox?\nThe more energy your body has at its disposal the more effective it is at flushing out waste materials from your\ntissues. Your metabolic rate is reduced during the detox as the action of the ghee, castor oil and basti therapies lower\nyour agni or digestive \u2018fire\u2019. Your body is in a sensitive state during detoxing so mental and physical stimulation\nwill result in energy being drawn away from the digestive system and will therefore reduce the effectiveness of the\ndetox.\n\n78\n\n\fOther Detox Options - Introduction\nThe purpose of an Ayurvedic detox is to naturally and gently purify, rejuvenate and revitalise the body\nthrough the removal of toxins, impurities and metabolic waste (Ama). Ama is undigested food and if this\ntoxic residue is left in the body it interferes with the functioning of the tissues and leads to imbalance,\nillness and disease. This creates fatty deposits, water retention, excess weight, painful joints and cellulite.\nThe goal of an Ayurvedic detox is to systematically release, melt, loosen, mobilise and eliminate these\nimpurities from the body before they build-up and create more serious complaints in the areas they have\nlodged.\nA detox creates balance in the body whilst also nourishing and cleansing the intestinal tract. This results\nin more available energy for strengthening the immune system and maintaining the body in a state of\nrelaxation, health and vitality.\nThe detox diets on the following pages can be safely followed by most people. However, diabetics and\npeople with sugar intolerances should consult a qualified medical practitioner before undertaking the\n\u2018Lemon Detox\u2019. The diets can be tailored to your own preferences and time constraints \u2013 just choose a\ndiet you feel comfortable with and try it for a few days. It is always advisable to start slow and build up.\nIt is best to start with the one or two days on the Mini Detox first. If this is comfortable, and leaves you\nfeeling refreshed and energetic, build up to four or five days the next month.

The initial taste (rasa) indicates the properties it possesses and\nthe therapeutic effects it will have. Thus, a bitter, astringent taste will have a very different action on the body than a\nsweet, sour taste or a spicy, pungent taste.\nSweet taste is composed of earth and water and is represented in sugars and starches. It balances vata and pitta,\nincreases ojas and promotes growth in the body. It nourishes and revitalises the body and creates contentment in the\nmind. It is found in almonds, dates, raisins, honey, fennel, licorice, sesame seeds, marshmallow and slippery elm.\nSour taste is composed of earth and fire and is present in fermented or acidic substances. It is heating and increases\ndigestive power by enkindling agni, the digestive fire. It balances vata, enlivens the mind, increases strength, reduces\nbloating and gas and promotes salivation.

It balances vata, increases agni,\nacts as a sedative and laxative and promotes salivation. Salt is found in kelp, seaweed, celery, Irish moss, sea salt and\nrock salt.\nPungent taste is composed of fire and air and is present in most spicy, acrid or aromatic substances. It stimulates the\ndigestion, increases appetite, acts as an expectorant, increases circulation, promotes clarity of mind, kills worms,\nalleviates kapha, reduces weight, clears obstructions, opens vessels and relieves blood stagnation. Pungent herbs and\nspices include; asafoetida, basil, black pepper, cardamom, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, eucalyptus,\ngarlic, ginger, horseradish, mustard, onions, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, sage and thyme.\nBitter taste is composed of air and ether and balances pitta and kapha. It is detoxifying, antibacterial and antiinflammatory. It also cleanses the blood and liver, stimulates the digestive fire and scrapes away fat. It is present in\nbitter herbs and foods such as aloe, dandelion, echinacea, rhubarb, yarrow and yellow dock.\nAstringent taste is composed of earth and air and is present in food and herbs of a constricting nature. It balances pitta\nand kapha, stops diarrhoea, stops bleeding, heals wounds, stops sweating and is anti-inflammatory. Astringent\nsubstances include black tea, beans, mullein, pomegranate, raspberry leaves and witch hazel.\nVirya is the energy or potency of a herb or spice and can be heating or cooling. It indicates the effect the substance will\nhave on pitta dosha. Sweet, astringent and bitter tastes are cooling whilst salt, sour and pungent are heating. Heating\nherbs increase pitta but reduce vata and kapha. They create sweating and increase the digestive fire. Cooling herbs\nreduce Pitta but increase vata and kapha. For pitta they are refreshing and help cleanse the blood as well as calm the\nmind.\nVipaka is the post-digestive effect the herb or spice will have on the body. Sweet and salty tastes have a sweet or\nmoistening post-digestive effect; sour has a sour or heating post-digestive effect and pungent, astringent and bitter have\na pungent or drying post-digestive effect. Sweet tastes are digested during the first (kapha) stage of digestion; in the\nmouth and stomach. Sour or acidic tastes are digested during the second (pitta) phase of digestion; in the stomach and\nsmall intestine. Pungent tastes are digested during the third (vata) phase of digestion; in the colon.\nThus, we can determine the long-term effect a herb will have on the body. Sweet vipaka will increase kapha and reduce\nvata and pitta; pungent will increase vata and pitta and reduce kapha; sour will increase pitta and kapha and reduce vata.\nPrabhava is a term used to describe herbs and spices that have a \u2018special\u2019 potency or effect that is unique to it and does\nnot always correspond to the rasa, virya or vipaka. Thus, a plant may be classified as \u2018heating\u2019 according to virya but is\ngenerally known to be very effective during high fever.\nIn the west herbalists have classified herbs according to their action on the body:\nAlterative: These purify the blood and balance pitta and are mostly cooling and bitter.

He will establish which dosha has gone out of balance and\nthen suggest lifestyle and dietary changes to help bring the offending dosha back into balance. He may also suggest\ningesting herbal formulas to speed the process along and his choices will be based on the energetic qualities of the herbs\nused. Thus, if the underlying dosha that is causing the problem is vata, which has the qualities of bitter, light, cold and\ndry, he may prescribe herbs that have opposite qualities to this; sweet, heavy, warming and moistening. He will also\ntake into account whether heating or cooling herbs (vipaka) are more appropriate and also whether there are any herbs\nwith special properties (prabhava) which may be indicated.\nIt is usual for an Ayurvedic herbal formula to have many different herbs in it, each creating a particular effect and\ncomplementing or balancing one another. If a herb is specifically known to treat the particular condition (prabhava) this\nwill form a relatively large part of the herbal formula. Other herbs will be added to treat the imbalanced dosha, whilst\nothers may be added to treat the tissues (dhatus) and channels (shrotas) involved. The state of the digestive fire (agni)\nand the amount of toxicity (ama) in the body will also be given due consideration and the necessary herbs added. Thus,\nsome traditional herbal formulas have as many as fifty herbs in them. The vehicle that is used as a carrier for the herbs\nis also very important so hot water or milk may be use to target vata, aloe vera to target pitta and honey to target kapha.\nThe time of day the herbs are taken affects the manner in which the body will respond as a herbal formula may act on\none particular tissue or dosha at 6am and another at 6pm.

In recent\ndecades medical research has confirmed that Aloe Vera is a truly amazing plant with an incredible array of medicinal\nhealing properties.\nApplied to wounds, aloe gel is a mild anaesthetic, relieving itching, swelling, and pain. It is also antibacterial and anti\nfungal, increases blood flow to wounded areas and stimulates fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for wound healing.\nIt also helps relieve burns and psoriasis. It is effective for treating inflammatory bowel disease, detoxifying the bowel,\nneutralising stomach acidity, relieving constipation and healing gastric ulcers. It has also been shown to reduce blood\nsugar in diabetics.\nAloe can help prevent arthritis and reduce the inflammation in joints already affected by arthritis. It can also inhibit the\nautoimmune reaction associated with certain forms of arthritis, in which the body attacks its own tissues.\nAloe could also provide nutritional support for HIV patients as it has properties which reduce occurrences of\nopportunistic infections, thrush, fatigue and diarrhoea. Research indicates that aloe helps stimulates the body's immune\nsystem, particularly the T4 helper cells - white blood cells that activate the immune response to infection. An extract of\nmannose, one of the sugars in aloe, has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 (the virus associated with AIDS).\nAloe has been found to significantly suppress the growth of cancer cells. It has been shown to help turn on the immune\nsystem by activating macrophages (white blood cells which \"swallow\" antigens), causing the release of immuneactivating (and anticancer) substances such as interferons, interleukins, and tumour necrosis factor. In addition, aloe\nseems to also promote the growth of normal (non-cancerous) cells.\n\n92\n\n\fHerbal formulas for common ailments\nIt should be noted that no herb or oil should be taken or applied without first consulting with a qualified herbal\npractitioner, especially in pregnancy or if taking any kind of medication.

Pukka Herbs (see resources).\n\n96\n\n\fA guide to using aromatic essential oils\nEssential oils are an aromatic constituent of many plants, flowers and shrubs and have powerful healing properties if\ndistilled and applied correctly. Only organic, grade A (clinic/therapeutic grade) oils with ISO/AFNOR certification\nshould be used if you wish to ensure that the oils you purchase will be safe and have the desired therapeutic effect. If\nessential oils meet the above criteria then many may be safely used to flavour beverages or food, added to base oils for\nmassage, mixed with bathwater, evaporated in aroma burners, applied topically to the body and inhaled from diffusers.\nTo prepare a herbal tea, add one or two drops of essential oil to a one-litre thermos flask. Be sure to only use oils that\nare recommended for oral consumption. When using essential oils on the skin it is best to mix them with a base oil such\nas sesame or almond in order to prevent possible skin irritations or sensitivity and also to increase their therapeutic\nvalue (a mix of 20:1 base oil to essential oil is ideal). If used neat on the skin it is important to test on the back of the\nhand first to check for skin sensitivity. Do not use undiluted anywhere on the skin if a reaction occurs.\nSerious complaints and imbalances in the body have often taken many months or even years to manifest as physical\nsymptoms. Essential oils can help heal the underlying problem and can thereby reduce or eliminate the outward\nsymptoms. However, this healing and balancing process may take weeks or even months depending on the severity of\nthe problem being tackled so patience and perseverance are vital.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cd301b1-3632-48a8-92e6-4160f0347d58": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cd301b1-3632-48a8-92e6-4160f0347d58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d92cb90-12c0-473d-a94e-fea1fe21e197", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f1d2fecab0c14f9c1be875e8c72187aeb2ed32bf0c3056c94bea62610dfb080a"}, "3": {"node_id": "788ea94b-a492-476d-9b6e-2e998140250a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc087f04d497d2253fa0aeb8d4eb7e19fcd305effe948b65162c95ed1328a195"}}, "hash": "a7847869326e5fb2111a6d98c38c1c780f5535c931646697a6060a059d0b0ad5", "text": "Prescribed drugs may well clear up outward\nsymptoms of a disease very quickly but they are generally toxic to the body and can further weaken an already\ncompromised immune system. Furthermore, they don\u2019t often address the underlying problem but simply suppress the\ncondition and drive it even deeper into the tissues. As with any medical condition, the disease, illness or complaint is\nboth a warning sign that you are treating the body incorrectly and also the body\u2019s way of releasing toxins or impurities.\nIf you suppress that process with drugs you have a short-term gain but a dangerous long-tern loss because the real\nproblem hasn\u2019t been addressed and dealt with.\nThe causes of specific ailments or conditions are manifold but are often a combination of wrong diet, wrong lifestyle,\nstress and lack of exercise. Eating well-balanced, freshly cooked, nutritious meals, reducing stress levels and exercising\nregularly go a long way to preventing the onset of disease processes. However, the judicious use of essential oils will\nundoubtedly help with any complaints or conditions you may be suffering from. However, herb and oils are powerful\nremedies and should only be taken or applied after first consulting with a qualified herbal practitioner, especially in\npregnancy or if taking any kind of medication.\nCommonly used essential oils:\nBasil: Use for migraines, mental fatigue, scanty periods, relaxing muscles, insect bites and chest infections.

This therapy is most commonly indicated for dry nasal passages, hoarseness of voice, stiffness in the head,\nneck and jaw area, headaches and certain eye and ear problems. It relieves mental and emotional stress, anxiety, fear\nand negativity.\nThe nose is the doorway to the brain, mind and consciousness. Prana, the vital life force, enters our bodies through the\nbreath. Lubrication of the nasal passages with medicated oil provides subtle moisture to the air we breathe and affects\nthe higher cerebral faculties and sensory organs. It promotes clarity of perception, intuition and stimulates memory. It\nalso enhances cerebral circulation and restores prana or life energy to the senses.\nThis self-treatment can be undertaken weekly (from one to three days duration) if you frequently suffer from mild\nheadaches, congestion or blocked sinuses. However, it is contra-indicated during colds/flu, high fever, pregnancy and\nmenstruation and should only be used under medical supervision if highly congested.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65ba6d44-eabe-4a78-9f81-6f295e1d89ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "65ba6d44-eabe-4a78-9f81-6f295e1d89ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "788ea94b-a492-476d-9b6e-2e998140250a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc087f04d497d2253fa0aeb8d4eb7e19fcd305effe948b65162c95ed1328a195"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9c6a8fe-f9d6-48a6-b881-4604003cbd2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47e3186f7d2f4042a2220cc75cf61bcd0baf6e75fc612815fed15cb5fd117c3b"}}, "hash": "f8d52e614bb0ea87005041ce2f18d32b17527e9c202e5dba9e9f126aca447674", "text": "You will need:\n\nMP16 (nasal oil)*\nMA634 or eucalyptus oil (inhalation oils)*\nSesame oil*\nBox of large tissues\nSalt water\nHot water bottle\nSteam bowl\nBoiling water\nBath towel\nHand towel x 2\n1 dropper (for applying oil into nose)\n* available form MAP (see resources section)\n\nInstructions:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nVigorously massage the head with warm sesame oil for 5 minutes.\nFill a large bowl with hot water and add 1-2 drops of eucalyptus or MP634 oil.\nPlace a towel over the head and bowl to keep the steam in and gently inhale the steam.\nContinue for 5-10 minutes - add more hot water and/or inhalation oil if required.\nFill a large bowl hot water.

Finish by gargling with salt water and then keep head warm and dry for rest of the day.\n\nAlternative nasya treatments:\nIf you do not have the time do the full Nasya therapy you may simply lie on the bed with your head tilted back and\nfollow the instructions for inserting the nasya drops. This is obviously less effective but still very beneficial. This may\nbe done daily when there is congestion and weekly as a preventative measure.\nAnother method of administration of nasya oil, when lying down is not convenient, is to simply place a drop of nasya\noil on the little finger and gently insert it into the nostril and inhale fairly forcefully. Next, gently massage the inner\nwalls of the nasal passage. Alternate left and right nostrils until each nostril has received a total of three applications of\noil. The lubrication and gentle massage helps to alleviate stress and release any tension in the tissues. This may be done\ndaily as a preventative treatment.\nIt is not recommended to use nasya oil immediately following the neti pot wash, especially if these therapies are new to\nyou \u2013 alternate days may be better. By taking just five minutes a day to incorporate this simple treatment into your daily\nayurvedic regime, you can enjoy the many healing benefits of the full nasya therapy.\n\nRecipe for Shakti:\nOn a low heat slowly warm 15mls of sesame oil in a small pan with \u00bc level tsp ground ginger, \u00bc level tsp ground black\npepper and \u00bc level tsp ground clove.

Each morning, either before or after\nbathing/showering, brush the skin for 2-5 minutes. Brush upwards towards the heart and use circular motions on the\njoints and long strokes on the arms and legs. Work up the body starting with the feet and legs. The hands and arms\ncome next followed by the back and sides. The back can be best scrubbed using a long-handled brush (use circular\nmotions on the lower back). Now massage the abdomen using slow circular motions and up and down motions on the\nsternum. When you first begin skin brushing the bristles may feel very rough \u2013 the body soon gets used to this and after\na few days you\u2019ll really begin to enjoy this pleasant invigorating experience. The bristles naturally soften after a few\nmassage sessions but you can run the brush under hot water if you really want a softer feel.\nTongue Scraping: Use a stainless steel or silver scraper and gently remove the white coating from the tongue each\nmorning before you clean your teeth. This white coating is \u2018ama\u2019 or undigested food and it often the cause of bad\nbreath. Once these toxic substances have been removed the breath improves and feels fresher, the taste buds come to\nlife and the digestion benefits from not having to cope with as much bacterial/toxic waste.\nGargling: Gargling with a small amount of sesame oil and coating the inside of the nostrils with a smear of oil with\nyour little finger helps prevent viruses and bacteria from entering the body. It is a great preventative measure against\ncolds and flu.\nNasal cleansing: Regular use of a Neti Pot cleanses the sinuses of old congested mucus and dirt and enables the breath to\nflow more freely through both nostrils. It is therefore an invaluable aid to yoga, pranayama and meditation and also in\nhelping prevent allergies, asthma, colds and flu. To use, mix \u00bc tsp of non-iodized salt with lukewarm water in your Neti\nPot. Bring the spout to your nose, bend forward over the sink or bath with the head tilted to one side and slightly\nforward. As water begins to flow through into the upper nostril, make slight adjustments to the head and Neti Pot\nposition until water to flows out of the other nostril. If the water enters your throat, instead of out of the other nostril,\nsimply make further alterations to the position of your head and Neti pot until it flows properly. Repeat for the other\nnostril. It helps to start by cleansing the nostril on the side that feels freer and less blocked with mucus.\nAfter cleansing the nostrils blow the nose freely through both nostrils to clear the nose of excess water and mucus.\nDon\u2019t close off one nostril when doing this as this may allow water to enter the ear channels. This is unlikely to happen\nbut should this or any other problems occur during this process, kneel down and bring your forehead to the floor. Raise\nthe hips above the level of the head and blow freely through both nostrils as before - it may help to turn the head to\neither side when doing this.\nA second technique to try, once proficiency is gained in the above method, is to direct water from the nose and out\nthrough the mouth. As in the previous method, make slight adjustments with the head and Neti pot until water flows\ninto the mouth \u2013 then spit it out.\nBenefits of nasal rinse:\n\nRemoves mucus and pollution from nasal passages and sinuses\nDaily use relieves allergies, colds and sinusitis\nCooling and soothing to the mind\nHelps prevent respiratory tract diseases\nBeneficial in the treatment of headaches and migraines\nAlleviates anxiety, anger and depression\nRemoves drowsiness, making the head and sense organs feel light and smooth\n\n102\n\n\fMeir Schneider and the \u2018Bates Method\u2019\nMeir Schneider was born with cataracts and by the time his eyes were operated on, at the age of four, his brain had lost\nthe opportunity to develop the ability to see.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6302140d-f177-4ca9-9bd7-ce82007fcfef": {"__data__": {"id_": "6302140d-f177-4ca9-9bd7-ce82007fcfef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9c6a8fe-f9d6-48a6-b881-4604003cbd2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47e3186f7d2f4042a2220cc75cf61bcd0baf6e75fc612815fed15cb5fd117c3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2159ec0-9c8b-4158-ad56-cc863249ac33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19322b068d24043d5fd20d93061eaac62da77541cfaf69930a1f8b72e3f1318d"}}, "hash": "c547f92dea63f7c42c9bea5ba3d5d2032e3e7fe7c2aba9a96e3caf75a960f97e", "text": "He had already developed nystagmus, which is involuntary movement of\nthe eyes, glaucoma, which is high pressure in the eyeball, and cross-eyes. The surgery, and the four operations that\nwere done later, scarred his lenses to the extent that light could hardly penetrate through them. By the age of 7 he was\ndeclared legally blind for life, and for the next ten years did all his reading in Braille. Today he can even read the small\nprint on his unrestricted driver's licence. Meir broke boundaries and proved that eyes cannot only get worse, as is the\ncommon belief, but can also improve.\nAt the age of 17 Meir was introduced to vision improvement exercises, a method developed by Dr. William Bates over\n100 years ago. In his studies of visual function, Bates observed how people behaved visually when they see perfectly\nand based on these observations, he developed a series of exercises to mimic optimal visual behaviour. He also learned\nhow people create refractive errors - nearsightedness (myopia) far-sightedness (hyperopia), middle-age farsightedness\n(presbyopia), and astigmatism. In every case of refractive error he found \"a strain of the mind\" that was held in the\nbody, the face, and especially the eyes. This anxiety, he found, was relived and relayed continuously along the body's\nneural pathways. To relieve chronic tension in the eyes, as in the rest of the body, Bates hypothesized, one must learn\nto use them properly and to relax them often; every Bates exercise is a relaxation technique.\nProbably Bates' greatest gift was his ability to view medicine in a different light. Organs that could be seen as\nmechanical objects: the eye as a camera or the heart as a pump, could also be viewed holistically, as parts of an\ninterdependent system. The body could be seen as intrinsically passive, and so requiring health care (drugs, surgery,\ncorrective lenses) or as living tissue, with a built-in consciousness and a capacity for learning. Bates favoured the latter\nview.\nIt was already known in Bates' time that the tissue of the retina, the back of the eye where light falls on photosensitive\ncells, is brain tissue. The parts of the brain associated with vision are as much a part of the visual apparatus as the eyes\nare. In fact the brain is the dominant part of the visual system and Bates reasoned that seeing is psychological\nbehaviour, which can be done well or done poorly. \"We see very largely with the mind,\" he wrote, \"and only partly\nwith the eyes\u201d. Vision depends on the mind's interpretation of the impression on the retina. What we see is not that\nretinal impression but our own interpretation of it. But when, as a coping response that has become habitual, the mind\nrefuses to let the eye see properly, a deliberate act of imagination can help.\nThus, Bates would invite patients to appreciate and visualize the forms and blackness of letters on an eye chart until the\npatients would at last give themselves permission to relax and see the letters. With the help of a retinoscope, which\nallows the user to determine the degree of visual clarity and nature of the subject's refractive error, Bates checked\nhundreds of thousands of eyes and the results surprised him. He found that normal 20/20 vision wasn\u2019t constant and\nnone of the eyes he examined had perfect vision around the clock. Normally sighted eyes drifted off to moments of\nfarsightedness, nearsightedness, and astigmatism, and then picked up again to 20/20. Bad vision got worse, got a little\nbetter, and even had flashes of perfect vision. Temporary anxieties often produced refractive error.\nBates had been taught that in daytime, full colour vision is sharpest in a small area in the centre of the retina called the\nmacula, especially in the tiny centre of the macula, the fovea. The macula is sculpted into a parabolic receiver - like an\nantenna dish, but for light - with the fovea at the pit. Vision at the fovea is 20/20; 10 degrees off centre, it is 20/4000,\nwithin the realm of legal blindness. The correctly functioning eye sees the small detail it is focusing on best - a\ncharacteristic called central fixation. To see many details equally well, a correctly functioning eye will flit rapidly from\none sharply realized detail to another; Bates called it shifting. Good daytime vision is passive and effortless, consisting\nof automatic and continual central fixation and shifting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2159ec0-9c8b-4158-ad56-cc863249ac33": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2159ec0-9c8b-4158-ad56-cc863249ac33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "6302140d-f177-4ca9-9bd7-ce82007fcfef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c547f92dea63f7c42c9bea5ba3d5d2032e3e7fe7c2aba9a96e3caf75a960f97e"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc8140a4-8e22-48cc-9b4f-51d4c550d6f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8692bc22ea3b55129eb54826bb85205c749c1eda9b047bef16657fd34c3c297"}}, "hash": "19322b068d24043d5fd20d93061eaac62da77541cfaf69930a1f8b72e3f1318d", "text": "The poorly functioning eye overstrains and then numbs the\nmacula until it has lost central fixation.\nThe exercises that he devised release the tension from over-strained eyes and help regain central fixation ability.\nThere are now Meir Schneider centres teaching \u2018The Bates Technique\u2019 all around the world.\n\n103\n\n\fEye exercises\nSleep in the dark: Curtains should shut out streetlights; the eyes get full rest only in darkness.\nPalming: Rub your hands together, close your eyes and gently cover them with your hands so you block out all light but without\npressing on the eye. Breathe easily and picture a black object \u2013 imagine this object on a black background and then paint the world\nblack. Do this whenever the eyes need relaxing.\nPeripheral vision: Take a black piece of paper four inches square and stick it between your eyebrows so you can't see in front of\nyou. Sit in a dark room and rapidly move two flashlights out to either side of you while looking straight ahead. As your peripheral\nvision improves, increase the challenge by moving the flashlights further back. Alternatively you may do this exercise in normal light\nand substitute waggling movements of the fingers for the movement of the flashlights. This exercise will improve your peripheral\nvision and train both eyes to work together.\nShifting: Look at a picture on the wall in a relaxed way and move your attention from one small detail to another. Then close your\neyes and visualize what you have just seen. Repeat. The same brain cells work for visualizing as for seeing and this exercise helps\nretrain them and strengthens the macula.\nBlinking: Sit easily, breathing gently and blink rapidly one hundred times - then close the eyes and visualize blinking a hundred\ntimes. Repeat. This massages and cleanses the eyes. In times of stress, just when blinking and relaxed breathing would be most\nuseful, we are most likely to suspend these essential functions.\nFocusing: Place the index finger 6 inches in front of the eyes and, for approx 30 seconds, alternate your focus from your finger to an\nobject on the horizon. This should be simple and smooth with no strain or discomfort. The speed of alternating may increase as\nstrength of eye muscles improve.\nFar-Reading: Place some reading material on a wall, relax, breathe easily and read from a distance that is comfortable \u2013 increase the\ndistance gradually each day (read for 30 seconds).\nNear-Reading: Relax, breathe gently and place reading material at the nearest distance that is comfortable to read from. Decrease\ndistance very gradually each day (read for 30 seconds).\nColours: With eyes CLOSED look towards sun (or full spectrum light) for 30 seconds and then turn away. Watch the colours in a\nrelaxed and gentle way\u2013 massage eyes \u2013 watch colours again (for as long as is comfortable). Repeat.\nEye positioning: Hold eyes in a relaxed fashion for 30 seconds in each direction - look up-left; look down-left; look up-right; look\ndown-right; look through third eye/centre of eyebrows; focus on tip of nose; imagine looking at tongue. Do not strain and look for as\nlong as is comfortable. Increase time each day if comfortable (30 secs max.).\nTramlines: Draw a circle with tramlines and place on a wall in front of you. Now circle the eyes clockwise round the train-line for 30\nseconds. Repeat in an anti-clockwise direction.\nDotting: Draw a circle and randomly place a few dots within the circle.

Conditions such as mood swings, cramps, excessive bleeding, irregular cycles, hot flashes, and\nseemingly insatiable cravings affect hundreds of thousands of women.\nAyurvedic therapy is not based purely on the removal of symptoms; rather, it empowers the body to heal itself. In this\nregard treatment identifies and addresses the initial cause of PMS. The root cause of most cases of PMS begins early in\nthe lifestyle of a menstruating young woman.\nCharaka and the other Ayurvedic authorities state that the suppression of natural urges, stress, excessive sex and\nexcessive physical exercise, along with an improper diet and lifestyle, are major contributors to the cause of female\nreproductive disorders. There is a general consensus among Ayurvedic physicians as to why the excessive amount of\nfemale disorders plague the West and not the East, and it has much to do with honouring the cycle itself. In India, the\nmenstrual cycle is a highly respected cycle that is an expression of the female connectedness to the cycles of the moon.\nThis lunar cycle regulates the tides, migrations, mating times and the twenty-eight day cycle of menstruation.\nMenses is a time when the female body provides extra energy to insure an effective and complete flushing of waste\nproducts. It is a natural time of cleansing and rejuvenation, traditionally accompanied by a time of rest or light duty. In\ntraditional cultures there were extended families that supported women during their monthly cycle and through\nmenstruation. Whilst, in the West, this is rarely the case it does not mean that the modern working women cannot\nrespect this time of the month by reducing stress and opting for a lighter work load. Ignoring this cycle is often at the\nroot of the premenstrual syndrome. If there is some desire to rest during menstruation and this is not provided, then\nsymptoms of some sort are sure to come about. Ayurvedic doctors generally recognise that the menstrual cycle and\nmonthly cleansing is one of the factors that lead to the generally longer life span of women compared to men.\nThe simple dietary and lifestyle adjustments recommended below can help offer relief from common premenstrual and\nmenstrual syndromes, and facilitate a smooth transition into menopause. A healthy cycle will also naturally enhance\nfertility.\nGeneral recommendations:\n\u2022\n\nMaintain a proper balance of rest and activity throughout the month. Rest during the period and practice\nmeditation, pranayama, yoga and exercise.\n\n\u2022\n\nTake 2 tbsp of pure aloe vera juice after meals twice a day, but not during or within 3 days of the end of the\nmenstrual flow.\n\n\u2022\n\nPerform a daily self-massage with warm sesame oil followed by a hot bath or shower.

Joints hold the bones together and are designed to provide movement within the skeletal system. The main\nfunction of bone is support, while the joints allow a certain amount of flexibility and to our structure. The synovial\njoints, where the ends of bone are connected by a joint cavity or capsule containing synovial fluid, allow freedom and\nfluidity in the articulation of our movements.\nThe supportive tissues; ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue, are kapha dosha, while the joint cavity or space where\nthe bones meet is an element ruled by vata dosha. The joint capsule provides a container for the slippery synovial fluid,\nagain a kapha substance that lubricates the ends of the bone surfaces and also accommodates a tough, protective\ncovering into which the ligaments and tendons can insert themselves. It is through the ligaments that nerve impulses are\ntransmitted to the muscles signalling movement, a function of vata dosha.\nHealthy joint tissue and function are crucial to how we move and express ourselves through our bodies. According to\nayurveda, vitiated or disturbed vata dosha can create imbalance within the joints resulting in pain and discomfort. Most\ncommonly affected joints are knees, ankles, elbows, wrists, fingers and toes. When there is an imbalance in the joints, it\nis important to discern whether or not the imbalance exists with or without ama, a sticky toxic substance. A simple test\ncan be done with organic sesame oil. Massage the oil into the joint. If the symptoms are aggravated, then there is ama\npresent, a condition known as amavata. If the symptoms are alleviated by the oil massage, or stay the same, then the\ntreatment will begin with the removal of the causative factors and balancing vata dosha.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2088ef01-5a56-4879-8eef-a5464f53be03": {"__data__": {"id_": "2088ef01-5a56-4879-8eef-a5464f53be03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4251ceb-c3f5-46f4-9479-291795fdb17b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19126624286e8406ab66f7e0864a38a5039a6e6ca98247503495d2398baf50fb"}, "3": {"node_id": "29f61313-882a-4568-9fa3-4366168d015e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f144b034178a839b49607af9a166bbc4226e139fdee6101ab332b6be7fd162f"}}, "hash": "67375d32eeabc5f9acfcc689c48906c8b119010604b17c23e36d64c9e7e7615d", "text": "The dryness of vata can deplete the lubricating qualities of kapha and joint surfaces can become rough and brittle.\nCommon symptoms of vata imbalance in the joints are dryness, popping and cracking, and muscle tics and spasms.\nSome common causative factors are jogging, jumping, excessive exercise, injury, consuming too many dry foods, living\nin a cold, dry climate and irregular eating habits and lifestyle.

It can begin to block vital channels throughout the body that carry nutrients to the tissues and\ncause dysfunction within the joint. The immune system can begin to attack the ama stored in the joints causing an\ninflammation of the joint lining. Inflamed tissue can result in symptoms of excess heat, redness, pain, stiffness, and\nswelling. Acute inflammation, if left untreated, can cause damage or injury to the joint and bone tissue resulting in a\nchronic condition. Untreated chronic inflammation can lead to degenerative disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Ama\ncan be clotted together with dead cells which the immune system sweeps up. Because it can also be so deeply embedded\nwithin healthy tissue, the immune cells can become confused by the similarity to that which it has been scavenging,\nunable to properly identify the toxic invader from the healthy tissue; an \"autoimmune\" reaction.\nThe primary causes for accumulation of ama are improper diet, excessive exercise, exhaustion due to overwork,\nextreme worry, and the use of alcohol. It commonly occurs in cold, damp climates. For the condition of amavata,\nremoving the causative factors and eliminating ama from the body are paramount.

The\nunderlying causes of allergic symptoms are rarely from the allergens themselves, making proper Ayurvedic diagnosis\nessential. A main causative factor of allergies is a by-product of improperly digested food. This toxic substance, called\nama, is manufactured in the digestive system and is absorbed into the circulatory system. Once systemic, ama can block\nand clog the channels of circulation.\nThe removal of ama in the circulatory system will often play a primary role in the management of immediate allergic\nhypersensitivity. Depending on body type, the underlying cause of allergic hypersensitivities will vary. It should be\nunderstood that mental and emotional stresses are also common contributing factors in a hypersensitive allergic\nresponse.\nAyurveda compares the body to a field and allergens to seeds; if the land is not fertile, then any seeds that are sown will\nnot sprout. The fertilizer is a toxic residue called ama - a sticky substance formed in the digestive system from food that\nhas been incompletely processed. It lowers natural immunity and increases receptivity to allergens. This toxic byproduct migrates to the body\u2019s points of weakness, creating a vicious cycle by lowering resistance even more.\nAllergies to pollen and other plant materials also involve an imbalance of the Kapha dosha, which controls the lungs,\nsinuses, and fluid balance in the body. When Kapha is out of balance, exposure to allergens stimulates symptoms like\nwatery eyes, sneezing, coughing and fatigue.\nKapha\u2019s strongest influence is during peak allergy season, March-June. The presence of ama can weaken the thymus\ngland or spleen; both of which contribute to the body's immune system and trigger allergic reactions. However, eating\nmore of certain foods and herbs can help remove ama, bring balance to Kapha, and thus hold allergies at bay.\nThe first step is to minimize chilled foods and high-fat dishes (such as cheese, yogurt and meat) and replace them with\nwarm, freshly cooked foods, including plenty of asparagus and broccoli, both of which support the immune system.\nThen integrate the herbs turmeric and tulsi (or holy basil) into your diet.\nTurmeric activates the liver and strengthens the blood to help remove ama, and research shows that turmeric's active\ningredient, curcumin, has an anti-allergic effect. You can sprinkle a mixture of ground turmeric, cumin, coriander, bay\nleaf, and cinnamon in your food. You can also bring a cup of milk to the boil, remove it from the heat, add a bay leaf\nand a pinch each of turmeric and cinnamon and then drink it warm.\nHoly basil strengthens the immune system, reduces ama, and helps remove environmental pollution from the body. For\nan effective anti-allergy tea, bring a pint of water to a boil, remove from the heat, and for five minutes steep five holy\nbasil leaves, two pinches licorice, one bay leaf, a pinch of cinnamon, and a pinch of cardamom.\nYou may also want to try this Ama-Reducing Program for one month:\n\u2022\n\nSip plain hot water every half-hour\n\n\u2022\n\nDrink eight to ten glasses of warm lemon water each day\n\n\u2022\n\nAvoid dairy and wheat and favour fruits and vegetables\n\n\u2022\n\nEat a big, relaxing meal at lunchtime and a lighter meal of soup for dinner\n\n\u2022\n\nExercise for at least half an hour each day\n\n\u2022\n\nRetire to bed by 10:00 pm\n\n\u2022\n\nWaking up with the sun\n\nIf you are suffering from rhinitis or excess dryness, this is a Vata cause and would most likely respond well to the Vata\ntreatments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "593f3fb9-cf78-47e2-8d2e-34ad11ccac4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "593f3fb9-cf78-47e2-8d2e-34ad11ccac4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "29f61313-882a-4568-9fa3-4366168d015e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f144b034178a839b49607af9a166bbc4226e139fdee6101ab332b6be7fd162f"}, "3": {"node_id": "656e32b1-1f99-4179-b554-d88d3898d9e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce4de1ed70a9d9b19f984a5b7ab9e76d8b814709799a568149acdbfd69ec358a"}}, "hash": "b2ae6977d16e8f981fd4ef9146194a22a8100c7110384e44dd343260b6a2579e", "text": "If you are suffering from sinusitis, internal heat, or excessive irritability or anger, you may benefit from\nusing the Pitta treatments. If you are suffering from congestion or fatigue, the best option may be to select Kapha\ntreatments.\nVata causes: The vata body type is susceptible to various hypersensitivity reactions. In the case of allergic rhinitis, a\nvata imbalance will cause excessive dryness in the body. When this dryness finds its way to the respiratory system and\nsinuses, the protective mucous lining will dry up. This natural protection acts as a filter, temperature buffer, and first\n\n111\n\n\fline of allergic immunity. When this layer of mucous dries up, the airborne allergens of dust, pollen, and pollution act as\nirritants in the sinuses, evoking an immediate hypersensitivity response. The body\u2019s natural response to these irritants is\nto lay down mucous as a means of protection. The dryness alone will also trigger the body to produce mucous, making\nallergic symptoms a common vata condition. In this instance, allergic symptoms can be chronic and constant due to a\ndeep mucosal dryness rather than a particular allergen. The vata body type is also particularly sensitive to lifestyle and\ndaily routine. Most importantly with regard to allergens, the vata type must take the proper time to eat a large lunch in a\nrelaxed atmosphere without the distractions of television, magazines, or phone calls. Such distractions aggravate the\nvata aspects of digestion, producing ama and hypersensitivity reactions.\nVata treatments:\n\u2022\n\nNasya: sniff sesame oil deeply into both nostrils two to three times a day\n\n\u2022\n\nTriphala: take \u00bd teaspoon per day on an empty stomach\n\n\u2022\n\nGinger root tea: take three to four cups per day; also; also chew small pieces as a lozenge\n\nPitta causes: The pitta type will be subject to an accumulation of heat in the body and blood. The heat is produced as a\nresult of a physiological hyper-metabolic state needed to burn off the excess ama in the blood. This heat, as does all\nheat, will rise up in the body into the head and neck. When this heat rises up into the sinuses, the effect is one of dryness\nalong with the accumulation of impurities (ama) in the blood. The result of the dryness aggravates vata as we mentioned\npreviously, and the excess blood ama aggravates pitta. The sinuses respond by acting as organs of excretion rather than\nsecretion producing an allergic response. The treatment for pitta-based allergic response is twofold. The blood must be\npurified with pitta-pacifying herbs and the dryness must be dealt with, as in the case of vata.\nPitta treatments:\n\u2022\n\nTake \u00bd teaspoon of cumin seed as a lozenge during the day\n\n\u2022\n\nTriphala: take \u00bd teaspoon twice a day on an empty stomach\n\n\u2022\n\nNasya: sniff coconut oil deeply into both nostrils two to three times a day\n\n\u2022\n\nTurmeric powder: take \u00bd teaspoon with \u00bc cup warm milk, three times a day after meals\n\n\u2022\n\nNeem leaf tea: drink 3-4 cups per day as a detoxifier\n\nKapha causes: The kapha body type is classically the most susceptible to allergies and kapha imbalances and is often\nmislabeled the causative factor in most allergic conditions. It is the nature of kapha to produce and hold onto more\nwater, congestion and ama however, and the treatment of kapha in all allergies is a common mistake. The symptoms of\nmost allergic responses are kapha in nature with the production of congestion, fatigue, and malaise; but the CAUSE of\nthese kapha symptoms may be vata, pitta, or kapha. This diagnosis is crucial. It is, however, very common for the cause\nand symptoms of an allergic response to be kapha in nature. In this regard, the treatment is straightforward with the\nfocus on pacifying kapha with bitter, astringent, and pungent herbs and spices, in order to remove excess mucous.\nAllergy treatments can become more complicated when multiple causes are present. Imbalances in vata and kapha, for\nexample, can easily create chronic allergic symptoms. Treatment for each are opposite in nature, and care must be given\nto balance both kapha and vata at the same time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "656e32b1-1f99-4179-b554-d88d3898d9e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "656e32b1-1f99-4179-b554-d88d3898d9e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "593f3fb9-cf78-47e2-8d2e-34ad11ccac4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2ae6977d16e8f981fd4ef9146194a22a8100c7110384e44dd343260b6a2579e"}, "3": {"node_id": "3aeafc6b-137a-4212-bf14-4464f63b8893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e81a5aa1479134c1cdcc3b730d66d25794c2395de7ff48d73b10204b2747a1f"}}, "hash": "ce4de1ed70a9d9b19f984a5b7ab9e76d8b814709799a568149acdbfd69ec358a", "text": "Kapha treatments:\n\u2022\n\nTrikatu: take \u00bc teaspoon with raw honey before each meal\n\n\u2022\n\nSitopladi: take \u00bd teaspoon with raw honey three times a day on an empty stomach\n\n\u2022\n\nLicorice: take \u00bd teaspoon with warm water after meals\n\n\u2022\n\nMaintain a liquid diet one day per week, as ama-reducing therapy.

The pages that\nfollow synthesis a little of their teachings.\n\u2022\n\nPast experiences, good or bad, are our greatest teachers; in fact they are our only teachers. Brooding over past\nevents and worrying about the future fills our minds with toxic waste; it is a useless pastime and drains our\nmental power. How we develop and refine our mind determines our success, fulfilment and happiness in life.\n\n\u2022\n\nDuring every waking moment we have a choice; either stand back and quietly contemplate how to react\nappropriately to any given situation or to allow our lower instincts; our robotic, mechanistic instincts, to take\nover, without any thought or concern for the consequences of our actions. We always have the power to\ndetermine which attitude to adopt \u2013 we can either look at any negative or stressful situation as a crisis, a\nnightmare, a seemingly insurmountable problem or as simply an opportunity to learn and grow; it all depends\non our chosen interpretation of the situation.\n\n\u2022\n\nWe all have the capacity to allow ourselves to see the cup as half full or half empty \u2013 it is simply our response\nto events and situations that determines which it is to be. If we have the resourcefulness to cultivate inward\ncalm, by controlling our negative thought patterns, the outer world responds accordingly. All that is required to\ncreate a peaceful, harmonious outer experience is a bed-rock of inner peace and calm.\n\n\u2022\n\nThere are no mistakes or truly negative experiences in the relative world; it is just as it should be.

Without closing the first\ndoor the other is unable to open \u2013 it is the letting go that enables the other to begin to manifest. If we wish to\ncreate a new reality we must first create new thoughts, for the foundation of our relative experience begins in\nthe mind. It is our ideas about something that causes the outer reality and not the other way round.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe trick is to imagine, as vividly as possible, the outer experience or event we would like to create and then to\nallow the universe to take care of the details. If we cultivate an attitude of total expectancy, and allow dormant\nforces of true knowledge to awaken within us, we will be ready to clearly perceive the opportunities that\npresent themselves. We will be able to react appropriately and decisively to them and thus ensure their positive\noutcome. We must consciously and perpetually replace all negative thoughts with positive and uplifting\nthoughts. We must remember that if we are able to allow negative thoughts to dominate our thinking we can\nalso allow ourselves to be dominated by positive thoughts; it is our divine birthright.\n\n\u2022\n\nA weak mind leads to weak thoughts and actions. However, a strong and positive mind ensures success in the\nouter world and becomes a true measure of our success in cultivating inner peace and harmony. Everything in\nlife is first created first in the mind and then in our outer reality. If we take responsibility for our own thoughts,\nturning negative into positive, the world around us responds in a positive way. Inner peace and happiness is\nalways rewarded with a delightful outer experience. It is never the other way round.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe richness and quality of life is a reflection of the richness and quality of our thoughts so if we truly wish to\nhave a wonderful and meaningful life on this planet we need to ensure we cultivate peaceful, meaningful\nthoughts. If we patiently expect a positive outcome we will surely receive it but only if we prepare our mind\n\n116\n\n\ffirst. We must believe that if we can think or dream of anything at all it is because we truly have the capacity\nto realise it on an outward level.\n\u2022\n\nOur minds have immeasurable power and can literally materialize anything we desire so long as we remain\npatiently focused on what it is we wish to have. Thus, we need to discover, through relaxed contemplation,\nwhat it is we truly want from our lives and then we must direct all of our attention towards it. If we can direct\nour intention and attention to our innermost desires, in a relaxed and concentrated manner, they will begin to\nmanifest with ease.\n\n\u2022\n\nIf we delay the process of cultivating our minds because we\u2019re too busy pursuing other goals we\u2019re never\ngoing to achieve true peace and happiness. If we have a leaky pipe in our home and we delay fixing it, the\nhouse may eventually flood and the small problem becomes a hundred times worse. Or, if we do not take the\ntime to backup our computer files each week, we may eventually lose them all and have to start from scratch\nwhen it crashes due to a virus or hardware malfunction. Similarly, each day we delay refining our minds and\npursuing our innermost desires, we push our peace and happiness further and further away.\n\n\u2022\n\nTiredness and lack of motivation also result when we fail to follow our inner dreams and desires. Once we are\nliving and following our greatest dreams fatigue becomes a thing of the past, for every action then becomes a\nsource of fulfilment and joy. This brings sharpness, clarity and motivation to our lives.

If we cannot see the\ntarget we will never be able to hit it; we need to form a clear mental image of the outcome and the clearer the\nmental image the more effective will be the outcome. By seeing the outcome in the present, rather than in the\ndim and distant future, allows the results to come more quickly; imagine the success you desire has already\noccurred and that you are already reaping the rewards. Also, by writing down our goals we bring them to life\nsimply through the act of committing them to paper. This act allows clarity of purpose and we then begin to\nconsciously and subconsciously notice or seek out opportunities that allow them to develop. We must not let\ndoubts or negative thoughts get in the way \u2013 we must get into the habit of replacing them with more positive\nthoughts the moment they arise. If we ponder on negative situations for long enough we allow them to start\nmanifesting \u2013as we have begin the process of creating them.\n\n\u2022\n\nOne way of speeding along the process of achieving our dreams and desires is to help others achieve theirs.\nThe more we are in the field of success and achievement the more its energy is drawn to us and the faster our\ndreams can manifest into reality. By acknowledging another\u2019s purpose in life we also acknowledge our own. A\nlife without purpose ceases to have any meaning and eventually withers away but a life lived with purpose\ngrows and evolves in leaps and bounds. If we confidently work towards our goals and ambitions and aspire to\ndo only things we really love to do, we will achieve lasting peace and happiness.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe key to a joyous and happy life is to quietly contemplate our dharma or \u2018life-purpose\u2019 and, having\ndiscovered where our heart lies, applying our unique skills and talents towards achieving our purpose. We\n\n117\n\n\fmust let go of any disappointments or setbacks along the way and rejoice in every tiny success we achieve.\nTherein we find the objective of life itself and begin to experience profound fulfilment and happiness.\n\u2022\n\nThere are no limits in life other than the ones we set our self. We can change negative thought patterns and bad\nhabits in an instant if we so desire. As long as we consciously direct our energy and motivation towards the\ngoal we have set ourselves we can easily replace any negative thoughts and bad habits for with more lifesustaining ones. However, we should never do anything just because we have to; we should act from our sense\nof knowingness and righteousness. If it is the right thing to do we should do it without any hesitation\nwhatsoever, acting from our divine intuition; our heart centre.\n\n\u2022\n\nThere is no situation that is inherently painful or pleasant outside of our perception of it. They are both\nconditioned responses based on past experiences. When we begin to realise this we move into a new arena of\nlife; an arena of choice. Just because we experienced something a certain way in the past does not mean it will\noccur in exactly the same way again. If we react to a given situation with anger or fear it is because we are\nbasing our reasoning on past experiences; and past events do not usually pan out exactly the same way twice.\nIn this circumstance we suffer from false thinking and act from a position of ignorance; we fall prey to a\nconditioned response. We should aim to cultivate an attitude of non-attachment towards outer events and\nthereby prevent ourselves falling into the trap of fear and ignorance.\n\n\u2022\n\nRest, play and relaxation are as important to a successful and fulfilling life as anything we can ever do or say.\nThe amount of success we achieve in outer lives is in direct proportion to the level of peace and contentment\nwe cultivate in our hearts and minds.

The deeper the mind is able to dive into silence on a regular basis, the higher, and faster and longer our\nmental faculties work. There are many ways of doing this including gentle exercise, yoga, breath awareness,\ndance, music, prayer, solitude and walking in nature on a daily basis. However, the most powerful way to still\nthe mind and release energy is meditation, which should be practiced for at least twenty minutes twice a day to\nbe most effective.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor the mind to be stilled easily the body needs to be healthy and this means good, wholesome fuel in terms of\nfood and drink. The more fresh and natural our food the more energy our body has at its disposal; we are no\nmore than the fuel (food) we put into ourselves. If our food is poor, our body and mind are weak. If our mind\nand body are weak our thoughts are also weak. If our thoughts are weak our choices become poor, weak and\nconfused. Weak choices lead to poor decisions and consequently to poor, ineffective actions. Poor, ineffective\nactions do not achieve success and we end up tired, stressed, unfulfilled and unhappy. Therefore, the\nfoundation of our existence is the food we choose to eat and the lifestyle we chose to lead. The choices we\nmake in this area ultimately determine our success or failure in life.\n\n\u2022\n\nIf we choose to eat meat we dull our mind, as meat is a heavy food and hard for the body to digest. The\ndigestive system uses most energy, and if it has to digest heavy foods, it leaves very little energy for our\nmental faculties. It also builds up heat in the mind and body, leading to anger and violence and also to\ninflammatory conditions such as gout and arthritis. However, eating fresh organic fruit, vegetables grains and\n\n118\n\n\fpulses create energy, ojas and vitality \u2013 these types of food increase our prana or life energy and help us ward\nof stress. Old age and disease.\n\u2022\n\nSimply by allowing time to reflect on our lives, and contemplating where it may be improved, is to start a\nprocess whereby we may begin to discover joy in our lives again. The only way to improve our lives is to be\nable to notice and acknowledge what we did wrong yesterday and then to make a commitment not to fall into\nthe same trap twice. As we continue with this process our judgment becomes refined and our lives become\nmore successful.\n\n\u2022\n\nAs we begin to make positive changes we should remain alert to the consequences of these changes so that we\nknow we\u2019re on the right track. We may perhaps notice that on the days when we go to bed early, and\nconsequently arise much earlier in the morning, we have more energy and are happier throughout the day. We\nmay also notice that when we go to bed earlier we actually need less sleep. We may perhaps notice that when\nwe take the time to stroll in the countryside we feel much better, and are more caring and friendly to those\naround us. We may also notice that when we are able to get some rays of sunshine on our skin each day, our\nbodies feel healthier and more alive. We may notice we have more energy and the mind feels sharper when we\ndon\u2019t eat meat, or that when we have a light meal in the evening we sleep better and wake more refreshed.\nPerhaps we notice that a little laughter each morning, or playing with our children, releases \u2018feel-good\u2019\nhormones in the mind and body and then allows us greater clarity and enjoyment of the rest of the day.\n\n\u2022\n\nAs we begin to notice that as we change our thought patterns our outlook on life becomes positive and our selfimage improves.

Indeed, we finally realise that there is no real failure in life, only opportunities\nto learn and grow and become stronger in the process. As our energy increases, our willpower also increases,\nand we begin to find we are falling off the path of happiness and contentment less often. We may also find that\nwe are more able to cope with the consequences when we do. This knowledge and strength gives us a great\nsense of freedom and feelings of inner power that allows us to stick to our new way of being more easily.\n\n\u2022\n\nAs we begin to be more self-referral and less ego based we become more self-controlled and more able to hold\nback when a situation demands it. A once angry response to a situation now becomes calmer and allows for\nmore constructive ideas on how to resolve the particular situation.

As we begin to see the world in a different light\nand start to pay less attention to our doubts and fears we realise that failure is impossible. As long as we work\nsteadily and consciously towards achieving our objectives, success is assured and our desires are fulfilled.\n\n\u2022\n\nHowever, our happiness is just the journey on which we travel through life; it is not the final destination. When\nwe allow ourselves to stop and savour each and every moment, pure joy becomes our everlasting reality. When\nwe stop chasing the desire for success and achievement in the outer world we begin to find it is already present\nin our quiet inner world. As we start to live more and more in the present moment we realise that happiness\nand joy were always with us. We then become a source of pleasure and joy to ourselves and to those around us.\n\n119\n\n\fKey points for cultivating mental peace\n\u2022\n\nRemember to gently turn your mind away from negative/stressful thoughts and to place your attention on the area\nof the body where this negativity appears to be felt. Rest your attention on this area for a while, breathe into it and\nas the feeling fades, turn the mind to healthier, happier thoughts.\n\n\u2022\n\nRemember that fear, worry and anxiety are the largest drain on the body\u2019s energy levels and a major cause of\nillness and disease.\n\n\u2022\n\nTry to live in the present; enjoying and savouring each precious moment. Regret, or reminiscence of past events.\ndrain your energy and hinder your enjoyment and appreciation of the present. Accept what has been, what is and\nwhat may be, and enjoy each moment - for it comes only once.\n\n\u2022\n\nTrust in nature and have faith that the future will work out fine when unhindered by stress and negative thought\npatterns.\n\n\u2022\n\nUse positive language in verbal and mental communication with yourself and others. Try not to use words such as,\nI can\u2019t, I should and I need and replace them with words such as; I can, I will, I must or I choose. These words\nhave more power of conviction and are more likely to be acted upon\n\n\u2022\n\nBoost your confidence, self-worth and self-esteem by listing all the things you like about yourself, the things that\nmake you unique and all the things you are good at.\n\n\u2022\n\nRemember that it is only through self-confidence, happiness and inner harmony that you may pass joy and\nhappiness to those around you. Love and peace can only spread through the world, affecting each and every living\nthing when we are happy and loving within ourselves.\n\n\u2022\n\nHelp yourself to help others by radiating love, peace, honesty, understanding and calmness. Notice the beauty and\ngentle sounds of nature and spend time appreciating the rising or setting sun.\n\n\u2022\n\nBe non-judgemental and graciously accept the way things are.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "647f95f4-cc7d-472b-8ae0-6d09a883810f": {"__data__": {"id_": "647f95f4-cc7d-472b-8ae0-6d09a883810f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2c66365-fec9-4313-86f5-2344d4315adf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc34bd0d34d137f1113f4d9e3127baee1adee7d9e2e40b4493cad48060fbaa2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "64f82b93-34ea-451d-8fc8-f6f41dc77a39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b2981fd40b9706289bf4baa53bd9ebbe52197253e215561d5e643c7278aac41"}}, "hash": "df1b8762045c59b9fe468d733fa0e1ee5d22079f0d79e076b7914f40f76018a2", "text": "\u2022\n\nBe non-judgemental and graciously accept the way things are.

By thinking of the issue you would like to resolve and then asking yourself these questions the inner\nreality of the situation is often revealed. It is important to be really honest with yourself and to listen to your intuition.\nIgnore your intellectual mind and listen to your quiet, inner voice that would truthfully like to dissolve the particular\nissue in question, forever.\nFirst think of the particular situation, person, issue or problem that troubles you most at this present moment. Now\ncreate a statement regarding this situation, person, issue or problem that you think you have. Make the statement as\nclear as possible eg: my boss makes my job very stressful; my son shouldn\u2019t play on the computer so much; my partner\nshould help me around the house more often; my mother should be more understanding; if I had more money my life\nwould be happier.\nFor each statement you come up with, ask yourself:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nIs it true?\nCan I absolutely know that my statement or thought is true?\nHow do I react when I think this particular thought?\nWho would I be without this thought?\nWhat would I be like without this thought?\n\nDo not judge each answer too deeply; just be open-minded and relaxed and see what answer spontaneously appears. Try\nnot to be too intellectual or rational and listen to your heart rather than your intellect. See what you really think and not\nwhat you may \u2018think you should think\u2019 or what others may \u2018think you should think\u2019.\n\u2022\n\nNow see if you can change the original statement round so it applies to yourself rather than the other person. If\nyour statement was \u2018my son should not play on the computer so much\u2019 turn it round to say \u2018I should not be on\nthe computer so much\u2019 or \u2018I should not watch television so much\u2019.\n\nAsk yourself if this reversed statement is true or has any relevance on some level if you are very honest with yourself?\u2019\n\u2022\n\nNow turn the original statement round to it\u2019s opposite and then apply it to yourself. You might now have \u2018 I\nshould be on the computer as often as I am\u2019 or \u2018I should be watching television as often as I do\u2019.\n\nAsk yourself if this opposite statement could perhaps be true, especially at the present time?\u2019\n\u2022\n\nNow apply this new (opposite) statement to the other person or situation. For instance the statement may now\nsay \u2018my son should be watching television so much\u2019 or \u2018my son does need to play computer games so often (he\nneeds to distract himself from the fact his best friend has just been badly hurt in a traffic accident)\u2019.\n\nAsk yourself if this new (opposite) statement could perhaps be true on some level?\u2019\nBelow is a slightly expanded version of the above and may help you go deeper into the absolute reality of the statements\nyou create.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64f82b93-34ea-451d-8fc8-f6f41dc77a39": {"__data__": {"id_": "64f82b93-34ea-451d-8fc8-f6f41dc77a39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "647f95f4-cc7d-472b-8ae0-6d09a883810f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "df1b8762045c59b9fe468d733fa0e1ee5d22079f0d79e076b7914f40f76018a2"}, "3": {"node_id": "c45ad402-d4af-41db-9863-4da393f4655c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e604106d41dc576d2937b78930755735841aa83e69d56afc1c819856beeb8c79"}}, "hash": "5b2981fd40b9706289bf4baa53bd9ebbe52197253e215561d5e643c7278aac41", "text": "Just ask yourself these questions and wait to see if a little clarity and understanding begins to dawn in your\nawareness.\nCreate your statement and ask yourself:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nIs it true?\nWhat\u2019s the underlying reality of it?

You\u2019ll soon find that you are able to stand back and witness these thoughts popping up\nin your awareness and be able to let them go as quickly as they fleetingly appeared in the first place.\n\nIf you are interested in this line of enquiry we strongly recommend reading the book on which this material is based:\n\u2018Loving What Is\u2019 by Byron Katie.\n\n122\n\n\fThought Field Therapy (Tft)\nThought Field Therapy is a simple technique which involves tapping or pressing on energy points (marmas) to rapidly\nremove phobias, traumas, anxiety and depression. This miraculous phenomenon can seem bewildering to the patient\nwho has often undergone months and sometimes years of physiological counselling to control the problem; and often to\nlittle or no avail. The technique has been developed and refined over the past twenty-five years through the dedication\nand perseverance of Roger Callahan, an eminent and highly successful American clinical psychologist. Many\npractitioners now claim it has an amazing success rate of over 95%.\nAt the heart of his theory is the belief that behind every emotional problem is an undigested thought or \u2018perturbation\u2019.\nIn stressful situations our minds filter out anything we can\u2019t cope with in order for us to deal more effectively with the\nsituation in hand. However, the problem here is that if these issues are permanently blocked from our awareness and\nwe are never given a chance to deal with, them they may eventually pop up as phobias, fears, anxieties that bear very\nlittle or no resemblance to the original problem or situation. A mistake of the intellect during the stressful situation\nleads to a \u2018perturbation\u2019 in that particular \u2018thought field\u2019. It can permanently cloud our judgement surrounding many\nseemingly unconnected issues and creates further stress and often causes ill health or dis-ease. As the problem is\nsimply a wrongly \u2018tuned\u2019 frequency connected with that particular past event, it follows that removing or \u2018re-tuning\u2019\nthat thought field will resolve the issue very quickly.\nAyurveda views the mind in a similar way and uses meditation to rectify imbalanced that are present. Meditation\ninvolves introducing a sound into the body\u2019s vibrational field. This sound \u2018resonates\u2019 within the vibrationary blueprint\nof the person and entrains his/her vibrationary field back into balance. During the practice of meditation the mind\ntranscends through the various \u2018perturbations\u2019 or stresses and arrives effortlessly at a state of pure awareness or restful\nalertness. This is the realm of pure un-manifest consciousness (the quantum level) that is free from stress, imbalance or\n\u2018perturbation\u2019. As the mind is naturally drawn back from this quantum level to the manifest level of reality it entrains\nthe mind back into a state of normality. It infuses the mind with vibrant energy and \u2018irons out\u2019 perturbations \u2013 the more\nthis takes place the more often these perturbations are dissolved and collapsed and the more balanced the mind/body\nbecomes.\nWhile meditation releases stresses/imbalances/perturbations on a daily basis and slowly dissolves accumulated mental\ndebris Thought Field Therapy rapidly tackles specific and often extreme imbalances that are causing severe problems in\nthe present. The two therefore work hand in hand to create balance and harmony in the physiology. Meditation gently\nworks away at dissolving perturbations that may cause problems in the future whilst Thought Field Therapy tackles\nperturbations that have become a problem and need dissolving or collapsing quickly.\nWhilst it is advisable to consult a qualified TFT practitioner if you have a severe problem, many people have cured\nthemselves of simple or mild anxieties, fears and phobias using the \u2018algorithms\u2019 on the following pages.\n\nPlease refer to Roger Callahan\u2019s book \u2018Tapping the healer within\u2019 for more in-depth information.\n\n123\n\n\fThought Field Therapy Instructions\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n\nTune in to the thought field \u2013 this means thinking briefly about the problem you would like to resolve (a phobia,\nfear, anxiety etc) and bringing the issue briefly to the forefront of the mind.\nObtain a SUD rating \u2013 this necessitates writing down a \u2018subjective unit of distress\u2019 \u2013 using a scale of 0 \u201310.

Start with things you\nknow will be relatively easy for you to do without radically changing your existing habits or lifestyle. Once you have\nintroduced one or two changes, and found them beneficial, introduce a couple more. Try to be patient and refrain from\nintroducing more changes until the ones you\u2019ve already incorporated have become fully integrated into your daily\nlifestyle. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t follow them all of the time; just do as much as you can. In this way, the changes\nyou\u2019ve made will become second nature, and your friends and family will accept that this is the new you, and leave you\nto get on with it.

It is a form of yoga which uses\nvocal and mental sound-currents of both audible and inaudible frequencies. These subtle vibrations awaken dormant\ncentres of the brain, attuning the mind and body to the primordial vibrations of creation. Access to universal knowledge\nor truth, and spontaneously self-healing, naturally arise when we come into harmony with these sub-atomic pulsations\nin consciousness. The subtle harmonic vibrations of chanted mantras, both mental and vocal, act as a cleansing and\npurifying agent on consciousness. The yogic rishis of ancient India discovered that certain sounds brought them joy and\necstasy whilst others illumined the consciousness or brought tremendous psychic powers. Some produced profound\ntranquility or boundless energy and others brought freedom from fear or mental and physical healing.\nThese same mantras are still in use today and they still evoke the same results in those who are dedicated to practicing\nthem regularly. Mantras create a stable core in the centre of our beings, which vibrates in unison with the underlying\nlife force. In India, it is not unusual for homeopathic doctors to prescribe specific mantras instead of the usual remedies.\nIn Africa witch-doctors have known for centuries that a certain frequency of drum-beat will serve to break a fever and\nhave developed a repertoire of other rhythms to cure various physical and mental symptoms. Similar methods are used\ntoday by advanced radionic practitioners using sophisticated instruments. Even in allopathic circles, sound-therapy is\nbeginning to be utilised in the treatment of both physical and mental problems.\nIt is only relatively recently in the Western world, that it has been discovered that certain music and sound-waves have\nthe capacity to activate cellular healing when played to bodily wounds. And such sounds have been shown to promote a\nfar speedier return to health than by orthodox methods. So it is that medical science begins to vindicate the findings of\nthe ancient sages.\nWhat is an ordinary dose of allopathic medicine after all? It is no more than a substance composed of atomic particles in\na dense state of vibration. Homeopathic medicine goes one step further. Its highly diluted remedies appear to contain\nnothing of the original substance, yet they are highly potentised and radiate a powerful frequency which can replicate\nthe effects of the disease. This causes the body to throw off its illness without the effects of harmful drugs, simply by a\nsympathetic frequency. A sonic frequency works on a similar principle.\nMedical researchers in Paris have found that certain repetitive sounds played to cancer cells will eventually destroy\nthem. If lifeless repetitive electronic sound can make cancer cells disintegrate in the laboratory, how much more\neffective the living sound of one\u2019s own voice can be in toning the cells with the repetitive vibration of healing.\nMantra is known for its vibrant pulsation of subtle healing frequencies which purify both mind and body. Because of its\ncapacity to resonate in consciousness, it is considered by the great sages as the most efficacious method of unburdening\nthe subconscious and cleansing it of residual traumas. As many cancers can be traced back to unfelt feelings blocked in\nchildhood, mantra (with its internal massage of rigid cellular structures) often allows such frozen pains and tears to be\nreleased. On occasion even traumas of previous lifetimes have been experienced following a mantra session, allowing\nstudents to relive and release past-life memories which previously created hidden tensions in the body.\nIt is hardly surprising that mantra chanting also has a significant effect on our mind and body as, like everything else in\nthis universe, our body is made up of vibrating energy. Even though our body appears to be dense, every cell of the\nhuman body has its own frequency. There's a sound present in each tiny cell, however minute that cell might be.\nWherever there's movement, wherever there's vibration, there's sound. The body's inclination is to be in harmony with\nitself.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c32c000e-a24b-4e63-90c4-861674c218a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c32c000e-a24b-4e63-90c4-861674c218a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "49e1a644-c3c5-487c-ac67-8de32ed3d4a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "217988da118a1b4d2804e044d012fefb8b422602ec75c10767c45944f523d859"}, "3": {"node_id": "9752b545-a932-4492-be49-8042e4bbe3cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf3bb416909a808988674a3f776d11ac4d4c5d7a05b33f3b1077a37ed58ebfbe"}}, "hash": "7339ccf70905279fc4c44c46f994cf36c5cc3627a01f1577765a1d2a0382ccc4", "text": "The body's inclination is to be in harmony with\nitself.

This mantra builds a link between conscious divinity at every level of creation and our own ego-based\nconsciousness. Eventually, our sense of identity changes to include all life, even as we know we are living in an individual body.\nThe Sanskrit term Vasudeva means \"the In-dweller\" referring to the soul or atman. Since the soul is always divine and a part of God\neverywhere, the Vasudeva Mantra, at an advanced level, can be a vehicle for uniting with divinity anywhere in the cosmos.\nThe mechanics of the mantra are simple: When the twelve syllables are chanted, energy is rotated around the spine, stimulating the\npositive and negative poles of the chakras. The energy first goes down the spine, then back up. After the mantra is chanted many\nthousands of times, energy is rotated around the spine to such an extent that it becomes spiritually magnetized. This allows for\nhigher vibrations and octaves of spiritual energy to be invoked and held in the subtle body.

As Rama, it also refers to the avatar himself, as well as to the divine self within.\nTaraka means that which \"takes one across:\" In this case, the \"across\" refers to the ocean of rebirth, this samsara that keeps us coming\nback again and again to assume bodies and burn off, as well as accumulate, karma. This mantra, practiced by Mahatma Gandhi from\nthe time he was a young boy, will free one from the round of rebirth. Gandhi was heard to say \"Hey Ram\" at the time of his death,\nwhen he was pierced by an assassin's bullet. In The Ramayana, the epic story of the life of Sita and Rama (the seventh Avatar of\nVishnu), this and other mantras pertaining to Sita and Rama are given. However, this particular mantra is uniformly recommended\nfor transcending karma.\n\n139\n\n\fOvertoning\nThis chanting technique requires no singing skills whatsoever and can easily be accomplished by anyone with a little\npractice. It is practiced by Tibetan monks to achieve higher states of consciousness but is also a very pleasant way to\nquickly re-balance the mind and effectively remove stress and tension from the body. It is very effective for improving\nhearing and increasing alertness.\nOvertoning produces harmonics or pure notes and their flute-like sounds ethereally hover above the base tone or drone.\nThe deep, resonant sound is produced by making a deep \u2018ooooo\u2019 sound in the back of the throat and then altering the\nposition of the tongue and shape of the mouth to produce variations of that sound.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b495dd4-5607-43d2-b0ad-3c2f7a83b43f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b495dd4-5607-43d2-b0ad-3c2f7a83b43f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "22b799b1-8532-4cd9-852c-cd81a2416df7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b38b7423cfe90c33bb6469ab4ac5fda0cffe7174d11d6e92e4c1ba83f48432f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "446a399d-45f3-44ea-ab4b-c00e92e54f91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dec8f712f0010e6f572a9af9be61affe71da91ac0bb68f3cb716eed17b7b0695"}}, "hash": "6a0eb245199000e0b23cc8aa7944fe368d42dbbceb9f9e1f9a80c10b7a9d0535", "text": "The tongue is curled up and bends\nback towards the roof of the mouth and is then gradually moved forward. The resonance is amplified by pursing the\nlips, flattening the cheeks (the mouth slightly open) and allowing air to flow between the tip of the tongue and the roof\nof the mouth; the mouth being the hollow resonating chamber. A deep sound is produced with the tip of the tongue near\nthe back of the mouth and a higher sound with the tip of the tongue towards the front of the mouth, just behind the\nupper teeth. By slowly saying a long, drawn-out \u2018onre\u2019 as the tongue gradually unfurls towards the front teeth, the\ncorrect sound is produced. The deeper \u2018ooo\u2019 or \u2018uuu\u2019 vowel sounds are produced when the tongue is near the epiglottis\nand the higher \u2018iii\u2019 and \u2018eee\u2019 vowel sounds are produced when the tongue is near the upper front teeth.\nIf the tongue touches the roof of the mouth and air isn\u2019t able to pass over it the sound stops resonating and becomes flat.\nAs you become familiar with the technique you can experiment with altering the shape of the mouth, as well as the\ntongue, to produce a clearer, more rounded, resonating note.\nTry experimenting by imitating the noise of a model aeroplane as it twists and turns above you or a racing car hurtling\nround a racetrack. If you\u2019re not familiar with this sound ask any eight year old to demonstrate \u2013 they\u2019re usually pretty\ngood! This isn\u2019t \u2018over-toning\u2019 as it varies in pitch but its practice involves similar mouth movements. The harmonics a\nTibetan singing bowl produces when struck are overtones of a single note, and as one listens more closely more\novertones are often \u2018picked up\u2019.\nAs you continue practicing overtoning, harmonics will certainly be produced, though they are often difficult to pick up\nyourself until your ears becomes \u2018tuned-in\u2019 to them. Other people can often hear them before you do but if you practice\nin a good resonating chamber, that echoes the sounds around, you\u2019ll notice them much more quickly. Large, empty\nrooms, bathroom sinks, tunnels, bridges and churches work especially well. Cupping your hands behind your ears also\nhelps and practicing with other people can produce quite phenomenal sounds, especially if the room you\u2019re in is very\nresonant.\nAs you begin to hear the harmonics appearing above or alongside the basic tone/drone you\u2019ll begin to sensitise the\nhearing process and begin to find interesting, captivating sounds in the most unusual places and from the most\nunexpected sources. The sound of a washing machine or train can suddenly become an enthralling and tantalising\nexperience to the ear that\u2019s \u2018tuned in\u2019 to their harmonics. As you begin to explore this new realm of sound you may\nfind that you aren\u2019t tone deaf and can sing a few notes and keep in tune after all.\nYou will most likely find that as you progress ,your breathing improves, your voice becomes clearer and more resonant,\nand notes that you sing become sharper and more \u2018bell-like\u2019.\n\n140\n\n\fChapter 8\n\nRecipes\n~ Ayurvedic fare for health & well-being ~\n\nEveryone should be his own physician.

They are easily digested, particularly good for pitta types and excellent during the summer to combat\nheat. They are light on the digestion and calm and balance the mind (sattvic). They are refrigerant, antipyretic, alterative\nand haemostatic. They are good for febrile diseases, lung, liver, spleen and bleeding disorders, cancer, fever, heat stroke\nand alcohol detoxification. A plaster or poultice can be made from mung bean flour to draw toxins from the body and for\ntreating burns, sores, inflamed or swollen joints, swollen breast, mastitis and breast cancer.\nBasmati rice is sweet, both in initial taste and post-digestive effect, energetically neutral and balancing to all three\ndoshas. It is easy to digest, a tonic for the body, soothing to the mucus membranes (demulcent) and nutritive (helps build\nthe tissues) and mildly laxative. It is not clogging and very sattvic (clarifies and calms the mind). It is high in B-complex\nvitamins and generally well tolerated food in conditions of anorexia, poor digestion and vomiting. It is detoxifying and an\nexcellent convalescence food; it is also good for breaking a fast. Kicharee, a combination of basmati rise and split mung\nbeans, is an excellent staple diet for maintaining good health and in treating many diseases. However, bleached, refined\nrice is sticky and can increase kapha and ama in the body. Whilst brown rise is higher in nutritional status because it does\nnot have the hull, bran and germ polished off, it is more perishable and much harder to digest. Therefore, Ayurveda sees\nwhite basmati rice as the preferred grain as its nutrients are more easily available and better assimilated by the tissues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fac170d-c3f5-4313-8978-d1133a520330": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fac170d-c3f5-4313-8978-d1133a520330", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "446a399d-45f3-44ea-ab4b-c00e92e54f91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dec8f712f0010e6f572a9af9be61affe71da91ac0bb68f3cb716eed17b7b0695"}, "3": {"node_id": "f76a40cb-7992-4360-b97c-6d19b8d9a218", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "df95ced39d6692b1096c04b2abb657b0768e10f3bce434e8057642b336ab33e8"}}, "hash": "77aae03f5551c07853e50a60924dd5c857e6b0ba5d58b61418fd9cfcdf7eead1", "text": "142\n\n\fSauces\nRed pepper sauce I\n1 red pepper - diced\n1 courgette - diced\n2 carrots - juiced\n1 tsp thyme\n1 tsp oregano\n\n\u00bd tsp basil\n1 tsp salt\n\u00bc pepper\n6 cups water\n1 cup soya milk\n\nBring everything (except milk & carrot juice) to boil and simmer for 30 minutes.

Puree the beans and water in a blender until smooth and\nthen strain the mixture through a muslin cloth. It may be stored refrigerated for up to a week.\n\n162\n\n\fGhee\nMaking ghee at home\n\u2022\n\nPlace 2 lb of UNSALTED, organic butter into a heavy bottomed, stainless steel saucepan and slowly\nmelt on a low heat.\n\n\u2022\n\nContinue to cook slowly, keeping a wary eye all the while as it burns easily if heated too fast or on too\nhigh a heat. Bubbles will be seen rising to the surface and a residue of milk solids will be seen forming\non the surface. This usually clears in the middle allowing you to observe the liquid changing colour\nbeneath and milk solids forming on the base of the pan.\n\n\u2022\n\nWhen ready (about 30 mins), the ghee turns a transparent golden brown colour and bubbles begin to\nstop rising to the surface (the bubbles are the water content of the butter evaporating). The ghee burns\nvery quickly at this stage so remove from the heat as soon as the milk solids on the bottom of the pan\nbegin to turn brown and most of the bubbles have stopped rising.\n\n\u2022\n\nWait until the ghee has cooled but is still in a liquid form and then strain the ghee through a piece of\nmuslin cloth into a suitable container - jam jars work well.\n\n\u2022\n\nGhee has a long shelf life if stored in tightly sealed jars. Refrigeration is unnecessary.\n\nWhy is it so good for you?\n\u2022\n\nGhee is cow\u2019s butter with the milk solids and water content removed and is a very pure food. It aids\ndigestion, strengthens the body, increases energy levels, improves memory and brain functioning and\nincreases longevity.\n\n\u2022\n\nIt strengthens and balances the physiology but doesn\u2019t raise cholesterol or clog the liver and arteries.\nThis is due to its chemical makeup - predominantly short-chain fatty acids which are easily absorbed,\nassimilated and metabolised by the body for energy release. Ghee is high in antioxidants (free radical\nscavengers) and high in monounsaturated fatty acids, which are associated with the prevention of cancer\nand heart disease. It also contains linoleic acid, a chemical that may have anti-carcinogenic properties,\nas well as vitamins A, D, E & K.\n\n\u2022\n\nTaking 1 tsp to 2 tbsp daily will greatly improve your health but any more than that will start to have\nthe opposite effect and reduce digestive efficiency.\n\n\u2022\n\nGhee can be spread on toast, used to fry herbs and spices or simply added to vegetables during cooking.\nIt can also be used medicinally to help heal burns, reduce skin inflammations and on haemorrhoids and\neczema where it is especially effective combined with equal parts of pure Aloe Vera gel.\n\n163\n\n\fHow to make chapatis\nIngredients:\n1 cup chapatti flour\nCold water\n\u2022\n\nMix the chapatti flour with enough water to make a soft dough ball.\n\n\u2022\n\nKneed for two to five minutes.\n\n\u2022\n\nCover the dough with a small damp towel/kitchen roll.\n\n\u2022\n\nLeave in the fridge for half an hour.\n\n\u2022\n\nKneed the dough again for two to five minutes.\n\n\u2022\n\nDivide dough into four to six small balls.\n\n\u2022\n\nRoll each ball into very thin saucer-sized chapattis on a \u2018floured\u2019 board.\n\n\u2022\n\nHeat a flat skillet or frying pan (med. heat).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86ab7e31-ad40-4436-aeb9-1e7491609982": {"__data__": {"id_": "86ab7e31-ad40-4436-aeb9-1e7491609982", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a64267ea-d351-4419-ab5a-72d1c8f25583", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53bc5ef8621e20c79cc36e52e94cd532ec18aacf6aa2b544c285c79b386823f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bf943e1-3d20-4d5d-9d42-01ab47c2f9ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad2b6c1383f809901c241326812de5d6e412fe1531a330ff6d49fa13652f6fc8"}, "3": {"node_id": "d48a5275-f74a-4c82-ad46-f2dbad83fbb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ebffeb3ddbcd91f51f085e8bf5a17bda07d1cfe209c05a58fe8560fec3b1b185"}}, "hash": "4d23fe2ee1b18ef865a2947705e0fbac100d032b4f86a921a0dbb36d2ba24863", "text": "\u2022\n\nHeat a flat skillet or frying pan (med. heat).\n\n\u2022\n\nPlace one chapatti on the skillet for approx. 30 secs.\n\n\u2022\n\nTurn over with a fish slice and heat until it begins to rise a little.\n\n\u2022\n\nTurn the chapatti over again and remove once it has risen slightly.\n\n\u2022\n\nRepeat this process with the rest of the chapattis.\n\n\u2022\n\nServe with a drizzle of ghee or Udo\u2019s oil.\n\n(opt: Vata churna can be added to the dough mix at the start of the process)\n\n164\n\n\fFor the kitchen\nImplements\nOscar Juicer\nWater Distiller\n\nBlender\nFood Processor\n\nGrinder\nWok\n\nCoriander seeds\nCumin\nCumin Seeds\nCurry Powder\nDill\nFennel\nFennel Seeds\nFenugreek\nGinger\nHibiscus\nMint\nMustard Seeds\nNutmeg\n\nOregano\nPaprika\nParsley\nPeppercorns\nRosemary\nSaffron\nSage\nTarragon\nThyme\nTurmeric\nVanilla Pods\n\nFigs\nPears\n\nRaisins\nSultanas\n\nBulgur Wheat\nChapatti Flour\nCouscous\nGram (chickpea Flour)\n\nMillet\nRed Lentils\nYellow Mung Dhal\n\nPine Nuts\nPumpkin Seeds\n\nSesame Seeds\nSunflower Seeds\n\nOlive\nPumpkin\n\nSunflower\nUdo\u2019s\n\nCider Vinegar\nDesiccated Coconut\nMustard\nPesto\nSoy Sauce\nSalt\nCoconut Milk\nOat Milk\n\nRice Milk\nSoya Milk\n\nHerbs\nAniseed\nAsafoetida (hing)\nBasil\nBay Leaves\nBlack Pepper\nCaraway Seeds\nCardamom\nCardamom Seeds\nCayenne\nCinnamon\nCinnamon Sticks\nCloves\nCoriander\nDried fruits\nApricots\nDates\n\nGrains/pulses/lentils\nAborrio Rice\nBarley\nBasmati Rice\nBuckwheat\n\nNuts/seeds\nAlmonds\nCashew Nuts\n\nOils\nFlax\nGhee\n\nMiscellaneous\nHoney\nJaggery\nMaple Syrup\nDate Syrup\nSteva Extract\nBalsamic Vinegar\nBlack Olives\nCelery Salt\n\n165\n\n\fChapter 9\n\nInspirational quotes & sayings\n~ from around the world & through the ages ~\n\nI was free and I had shrunk.

It is also\nused as an engine de-greaser, garage floor cleaner and car wash detergent. It readily penetrates the skin and can\naccumulate in our bodily tissues causing damage and irritation to the skin. It also damages the immune system and\ncan cause hair loss with long-term use. It has been associated with the formation of cataracts, gum disease and\nmouth ulcers.\nPropylene Glycol: A petrochemical solvent used in anti-freeze, de-icer, paint, floor wax, brake and hydraulic fluid,\npet food and many cosmetic and personal care products. It is a humectant or moisture retainer and prevents things\ndrying out. It can make the skin feel smooth but beyond that it has no therapeutic benefits. It has been implicated\nwith contact dermatitis, kidney damage and liver abnormalities. It may cause skin rashes, gastro-intestinal\ndisturbances, nausea, headaches, vomiting and central nervous system depression.\nFluoride: It is found in most toothpaste products and has been shown to be poisonous when ingested over long\nperiods as it steadily accumulates in our tissues.\nTalc: This is chemically similar to asbestos and is a known cancer causing substance.

Unfortunately, these studies also suggest that sunscreens may actually do more harm than\ngood and that correct nutrition and sensible exposure time may be all that is needed to stay safe. Sunscreen lotions\nmay well be effective in protecting the skin from bad sunburn but there are other things going on below the surface\nof the skin that could create more serious problems in later years.\nResearchers at the UK's Restoration of Appearance and Function Trust found that free radical damage beneath the\nsurface of the skin was reduced by approximately 50 percent in skin samples treated with sunscreen, compared to\nunprotected skin. While that may seem to be effective, researchers determined that the actual \"free-radical protection\nfactor\" was only 2. In other words, the sun protection factor of 20+ held true only with ultraviolet B (UVB) rays the rays that cause sunburn. But protection from the free-radical damage that corrupts DNA and may prompt skin\ncancer was judged to be insufficient.\nSunscreen use may well help prevent burning but because people feel safer they spend many extra hours in the sun\nand the additional hours of exposure may add up to cumulative DNA damage and skin cancer because a\nconsiderable amount of UVA rays are still getting through.\nIt is important to remember the health benefits of adequate exposure to sunlight, especially in terms of the\nmanufacture of vitamin D. Those who live in extreme northern and southern latitudes are often vitamin D deficient\nbecause their exposure to sunlight is too low. A lack of vitamin D negatively impacts just about every system in the\nbody so what we need is balance - the right amount of sun exposure with not too much, and not too little. Sunlight\nis not just good for us, it's essential. But excessive exposure leads to sunburn, which is obviously not good for the\nskin. Nevertheless, sunburns do serve a purpose; they are nature's way of telling us that we're getting too much sun.\nWhen you start turning red, you're done - your body has had enough sunlight exposure.\nProper nutrition also plays a key role in preventing skin damage. An adequate intake of Vitamins C and E are very\nimportant to relieving stress to the skin and reducing the risk of skin cancer. Folic acid is destroyed rapidly by heat,\ncold, and exposure to sunlight. In fact, it is sunlight's destructive effect on folic acid in the skin, not the actual sun\nexposure itself that accounts for a significant part of the skin cancer problem. The best dietary sources of folic acid\ninclude spinach and other dark green vegetables, brewers yeast, lima beans, cantaloupe, watermelon and liver from\norganically raised animals.\nSunbathing & Sunscreens (excerpt from the Key to Health and Rejuvenation, www.authorhouse.com)\n....\"The sun is completely harmless unless we expose our bodies to it for unduly long periods of time, especially\nbetween 10am and 3pm (during the summer).

Sunscreens, however, interfere with our natural response to sunlight.\nA British medical report, released in July 1996 and published as the lead article in the prestigious British Medical\nJournal, showed that the use of sunscreens might encourage skin cancer because they prompt people to stay in the\nsun far too long. Their use can postpone the onset of sunburn by many hours. Most people think that this is\nadvantageous whereas in fact it puts their lives at risk. The doctors who edited the report cited studies conducted in\n1995 in Western Europe and Scandinavia, which showed that frequent users of sunscreen lotion actually suffered\ndisproportionately higher rates of skin cancer. The report says: \u201cSunscreens containing only ultraviolet B blocks\nprotect against sunburn and therefore enable greater exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) than would otherwise be\npossible to obtain.\u201d In other words, many sunbathers expose themselves to much more UVA than they would if they\ndidn\u2019t use screens. Sunburn in fact is the body\u2019s natural defence response against more serious damage such as skin\ncancer.\n\n177\n\n\fWithout sunscreen your skin would begin to itch uncomfortably if it was exposed to too much sunlight. However, by\nusing a sunscreen, you would not notice when your body has had enough of it because your first line of defence -sunburn -- has been crippled. This would lead to overexposure of UVA that together with other internal toxins might\ncause skin cancer. Under normal conditions (without sunscreen) you would never get too much UVA even if you\nwere lying in the sun for five hours. Instead, you would burn your skin heavily through overexposure to UVB.\nAlthough sunburn can impair immune functions and damage the skin, there is no proof that it can cause skin cancer.\nThe above report stated that medical experts know \u201clittle about the precise relation between sunburn and skin\ncancer.\u201d This includes the fatal type of skin cancer, the malignant melanoma. Despite the enormous amount of\nresearch done on skin cancers, there has been no indication that malignant melanoma has any links with UV\nexposure. But what is known for sure is that sunscreen does not only fail to prevent skin cancer but on the contrary\nencourages it by amplifying UVA exposure. This makes sunscreens more dangerous than UV light could ever be.\nThe question remains whether sunscreens that are made to block out both the UVA and UVB radiation could solve\nthe problem? Research has shown that they don\u2019t prevent skin cancer either. There are more people suffering from\nskin cancer today who have no or only very little exposure to sunlight. Those who live mostly outdoors, at high\naltitudes, or near the equator, have the lowest incidence of skin cancers. But those who work under artificial lighting\nare the most susceptible.\nThe average American, for example, spends twenty-two hours a day indoors beneath and around artificial light.\nDuring the winter season most of the working population in the cities never even get to see the daylight, except\nthrough windows that reflect UV light. Incandescent light has a narrow band compared to sunlight and is known to\nweaken natural immunity (a Russian study showed that workers who are exposed to UV light during working hours\nsuffer 50% fewer colds than those who are deprived do). A weak immune system cannot properly defend itself\nagainst disease, and that includes skin cancer!\nResearcher Dr. Helen Shaw and her research team conducted a melanoma study at the London School of Hygiene\nand Tropical Medicine, and the Sydney Melanoma Clinic at Sydney Hospital. They found that office workers had\ntwice the incidence of the deadly cancer as people who work outdoors. The results of the study were published in\n1982 by the British medical journal Lancet. Dr. Shaw proved that those who spend most of their time sunbathing\nhave the lowest risk of developing skin cancer. By contrast, office workers who were exposed to fluorescent light\nduring most of their working days had the highest risk of developing melanomas. She also discovered that\nfluorescent lights cause mutations in cultures of animal cells.\nDr. Shaw\u2019s research lead to the conclusion that both in Australia and Great Britain, melanoma rates were high\namong professional and office workers, and low in people working outdoors. In other words, the Australians and\nBritish would be better off spending more time outside where there is plenty of UV light!
